### Recap

* The show started with a new "PTW Anthem" by a little-known rapper Buntownik (_The Rebel_).
* In the opening promo by Nietykalni, Pawłowski rambled on about their achievements, berating Okoński and the referees. He announced an additional PTW show for the next Sunday (27.07), including an appearance by, and a meet'n'greet with, the AEW TBS Champion and AEW Women's World Champion, Mercedes Moné. The show's name was not revealed.
* Diana defeated Lucy Couture in a fairly short match, retaining her GLAM! Women's Championship.
* Spartan defeated Flex Skywalker in a short match.
* Sigma Boy xD defeated Andi ZickZack in a competitive, fast-paced match.
* Skwarczyński proceeded to announce a Fatal 5-Way International Showcase Match including four Italian competitors and one from Austria - not revealed before the show. It featured two debuting stars: Nick Wesker #spelling TBC from Austria and Rick Eagle from Italy (mistakenly announced as Rick Eagle). El G won, stealing a victory from Luca Bjorn once again.
* In an impromptu match-up, Puncher retains PTW Championship against Flamingo.
* Okoński makes his entrance for usual charity auction of commemorative T-Shirt with signatures of PTW personnel. The winning bid was 500 PLN. Okoński calls out Caravaggio due to result of the bet from previous show - depending on Nietykalni's or Okoński's performance, either Caravaggio gets branded with Okoński logo tattoo, or Łukasz Okoński apologizes for insulting Caravaggio's late grandmother. Vincent proudly reveals that no tattoo was made. As a punishment, Okoński brings out returning Krampus as his opponent.
* After unsuccessful comebacks, Caravaggio gets squashed by Krampus
* Sullivan's real-life partner Lesya slowly transitioned to managerial role. In his match against Polski Niedźwiedź, she made multiple referee distractions, allowing the introduction of multiple foreign objects. The match ends when Niedźwiedź incapacitates himself with a cannonball outside the ring onto the railing. Sullivan brings him back to the ring, with a diving elbow drop for a win.
* Post-match, Sullivan injures Niedźwiedź's neck, trapping it in a chair and hitting it with another one. Miyagi Shida makes his entrance to chase Sullivan off. Livid Pawłowski enters with a mic, saying he wants to get rid of one of the performers unless they destroy that show. To make it possible, he announces Shida vs Sullivan in a Casket Match for the next show.
* Alex Brave makes an entrance with still unnamed valet. After a hard hitting match including multiple items, Okoński beats him using _The Brave Show_ sign as weapon.
* Post-match, Okoński says Pawłowski is right - their feud is not a game and needs to be taken seriously. He vows to be a leader that Pawłowski failed to be. He brings out Spartan and they make a deal to form an alliance against Pawłowski. Spartan shakes his hand and teases adding more members to even the odds against the 4 of Nietykalni.
* Skwarczyński announces the introduction of multi-show passes
* Up next, CJ Klakson, the "hottest free agent" who teased a PTW appearance over previous weeks, makes his entrance. He cuts a promo. He declares that despite the offers from all over the world, he decided to sign with PTW. He puts over PTW roster and declares his readiness to take any and all challengers. As per commentary, 'CJ' stands for 'Kacper Jeremiasz' spelled in English and despite never making official debut, he trained in Germany and other places already.
* Up next a match for the vacant PTW Underground Championship. After a competitive match, Razor beats Lopez with a sunset flip to become a champion.
* PTW referees cut a promo airing their grievances against Pawłowski and tease retirement. Pawłowski interrupts, blames them for being Okoński's referees instead of PTW referees. To put Herno and Klaudiusz in line, he puts them in a match against [Royal Rebels](@/tt/royal-rebels.md).
