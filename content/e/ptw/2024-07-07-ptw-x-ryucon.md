This is an upcoming show by [PTW](@/o/ptw.md) in collaboration with Ryucon, an anime/manga themed fan convention held annually in Kraków. The event will be held in Tauron Arena on Sunday July 7th, 2024.

### Build-up

* With the recent string of talent exits from PTW, and the organization's future uncertain, fans were speculating about PTW#6 being the last event.
* When Pawłowski and Ryucon both announced the show, speculation moved to the card - how many matches could they still build.
* Diana Strong vs Iva Kolasky will be the first all-female main event in PTW. While both rivals have faced multiple times on the European indy scene, they only clashed once before in PTW at [Underground 12](@/e/ptw/2023-02-26-ptw-underground-12.md), where Diana Strong was victorious.
* More matches have been hinted at, including a multi-man match, a tag-team match, and a surprise appearance.

Match card predicted from social media posts.
