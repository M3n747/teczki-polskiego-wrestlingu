This is an upcoming show by [PTW](@/o/ptw.md) in collaboration with Ryucon, an anime/manga themed fan convention held annually in Kraków. The event will be held in Tauron Arena on Sunday July 7th, 2024.

### Build-up

* With the recent string of talent exits from PTW, and the organization's future uncertain, fans were speculating about PTW#6 being the last event.
* When Pawłowski and Ryucon both announced the show, speculation moved to the card - how many matches could they still build.

Match card predicted from social media posts.
