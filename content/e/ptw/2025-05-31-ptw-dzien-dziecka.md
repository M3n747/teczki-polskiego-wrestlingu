"Dzień Dziecka" (_Children's Day_) is an upcoming show by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md).

## Build-up
* The Facebook event page suggests the following:
  * [Dawid "Puncher" Seńko](@/w/puncher.md) in action
  * ["Starboy" Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) returns, having recovered from his alleged injury (which did not affect his international bookings)
  * [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) in action
  * [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) to defend his [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md)
  * [Arkadiusz "Pan" Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) and [Łukasz "Prezes" Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md) to make a co-announcement
* Fed up with Pawłowski's bullying, referees [Klaudiusz](@/w/sedzia-klaudiusz.md) and [Herno](@/w/sedzia-herno.md) stood up to him. In a pre-recorded announcement they refused to carry Puncher's belts around, but Pawłowski stepped in and bullied them further. He gave them an ultimatum&nbsp;- read an announcement prepared by Pawłowski, or be terminated. Referees had no choice but to comply and publicly pledge allegiance to Pawłowski.
* On May 15th Klaudiusz uploaded a video of him and Okoński, in which the Chairman promised to help him resolve the issue.
* Following up on their feud including arena brawls, Shida and Sullivan will compete in a Falls Count Anywhere match.
* On May 23rd PTW confirmed the challenger for the [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md) - the returning Gulyás Öcsi, making his PTW singles debut.
