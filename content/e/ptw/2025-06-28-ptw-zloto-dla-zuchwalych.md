"Złoto Dla Zuchwałych" (_Gold for the Bold_) is an upcoming show by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md).

The name of the show is a reference to the Polish title of the 1970 film [Kelly's Heroes][zloto].

## Build up

* At the [previous show](@/e/ptw/2025-05-31-ptw-dzien-dziecka.md), Pawłowski created his new faction, "Nietykalni" (_The Untouchables_), consisting of [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md), [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md) (known together as "Royal Rebels"), [Dawid "Puncher" Seńko](@/w/puncher.md) and himself. As part of the deal, he granted each of them a favour. For Alex Brave, it was the return of his discontinued talk show segment "The Brave Show" with Pawłowski as a guest, announced for PTW: Złoto Dla Zuchwałych.
* On 12.06.2025 PTW announced Hannah Taylor from Liverpool, England, would take part in the show.
* On 18.06.2025 PTW shared a Facebook post revealing further details of the show:
  * Return of the Gold Rush Rumble Match, this time as a #1 Contender match for the [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md).
  * Both the [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md) and the [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md) will be on the line.
  * As mentioned above, the return of _The Brave Show_.
  * A women's match that will include [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md).
  * The conflict between Nietykalni and [Okoński's](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md) crew continues.
* On 20.06.2025 PTW announced [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md) as the first entrant in Gold Rush Rumble 2. He was last seen in the ring at [KPW Arena 16](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16.md) in 2020.
