During [PTW x RyuCon 3](@/e/ptw/2024-07-07-ptw-x-ryucon.md), Prime Time Wrestling owner [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) announced a summer training camp to be held in August, concluding with another PTW Underground show, but did not give precise dates.
Both are to be held in Kozłów, Dworek Pod Platanem, which is a complex containing guest rooms, sport facilities and a hall where wrestling shows can be held.
