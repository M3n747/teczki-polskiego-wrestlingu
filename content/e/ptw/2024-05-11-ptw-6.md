Total Blast From The Past was an event by [PTW](@/o/ptw.md), their second one to be held in the Warsaw metropolitan area, after [PTW#3 Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md). It was held in Legionowo, a satellite city north of Warsaw.

The event's name openly refers to [Total Blast Wrestling](@/o/tbw.md), a short-lived organization that held only two shows in 2010. TBW did not have any homegrown roster, and their matches featured mostly European wrestling talent of that era. Two of them appeared on this event:

* Canadian wrestler Starbuck, competing in Europe since 2003, mostly Finland and other Scandinavian countries.
* Norwegian wrestler Erik Isaksen, also a veteran of the Scandinavian scene.

Also announced were numerous foreign guests:

* English wrestler Scotty Rawk, once more defending his British Wrestling Revolution championship. This is his second appearance, after debuting at [PTW#5 Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) in February 2024.
* Welsh wrestler Flash Morgan Webster, known for competing on the British scene and several  Tag Team Championships across different promotions worldwide, mostly with Mark Andrews. Flash also had a run in NXT UK between 2018 and 2021.
* American wrestler Dirty Dango, best known from his years at WWE as Johnny Curtis and later Fandango. Since his release in 2021, Dango has been touring the American independent scene. 
* American wrestler Matt Sydal, most recently competing in All Elite Wrestling. This is his second appearance, after main eventing [PTW#3 Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md). Originally he was also in the card for Gold Rush, but had to cancel at the last minute.
* French masked luchador Aigle Blanc, who competes on the European scene. In his prior appearance at [Underground 11](@/e/ptw/2023-01-29-ptw-underground-11.md) he tagged with Senza Volto in the first round of PTW's inaugural Tag Team tournament.
* British wrestler Jonny Storm, now a regular face, appearing at all major shows except PTW#3.
* American luchador Samuray del Sol, best known for his time in WWE as Kalisto. Together with Sydal, they main-evented PTW#3 Legends.
* American luchador Lince Dorado, best known for his time in WWE as one half of Lucha House Party (with Kalisto and later Gran Metalik). Previously at Gold Rush, he had a match against PJ Black.

One more in-ring debut for PTW, not falling into either of these categories was Polish-born Babatunde Łukasz Ayegbusi, best known from his years in WWE as Babatunde, Dabba-Kato and Commander Azeez. Babatunde was released from his contract in September 2023, and according to Cagematch, had no wrestling matches since. He is billed as Baba-Thunder, a new name unveiled at Gold Rush.
