Total Blast From The Past is an upcoming event by [PTW](@/o/ptw.md), and their second one to be held in the Warsaw metropolitan area, after [PTW#3 Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md). It is to be held in Legionowo, a satellite city north of Warsaw.

The event's name openly refers to [Total Blast Wrestling](@/o/tbw.md), a short-lived organization that held only two shows in 2010. TBW did not have any homegrown roster, and their matches featured mostly European wrestling talent of that era. Two of them are scheduled to appear on this event:

* Canadian wrestler Starbuck, competing in Europe since 2003, mostly Finland and other Scandinavian countries.
* Norwegian wrestler Erik Isaksen, also a veteran of the Scandinavian scene.

Besides them, the foreign wrestlers invited are:

* English wrestler Scotty Rawk, once more defending his British Wrestling Revolution championship. This is his second appearance, after debuting at [PTW#5 Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) in February 2024.
* Welsh wrestler Flash Morgan Webster, known for competing on the British scene and several  Tag Team Championships across different promotions worldwide, mostly with Mark Andrews.
* American wrestler Dirty Dango, best known from his years at WWE as Johnny Curtis and later Fandango. Since his release in 2021, Dango has been touring the American independent scene.

One more in-ring debut for PTW, not falling into either of these categories is Polish-born Babatunde Łukasz Ayegbusi, best known from his years in WWE as Babatunde, Dabba-Kato and Commander Azeez. Babatunde was released from his contract in September 2023, and according to Cagematch, had no wrestling matches since. He is billed as Baba-Thunder, a new name unveiled at Gold Rush.
