Total Blast From The Past is an upcoming event by [PTW](@/o/ptw.md), and their second one to be held in the Warsaw metropolitan area, after [PTW#3 Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md). It is to be held in Legionowo, a satellite city north of Warsaw.

The event's name openly refers to [Total Blast Wrestling](@/o/tbw.md), a short-lived organization that held only two shows in 2010. TBW did not have any homegrown roster, and their matches featured mostly European wrestling talent of that era. Some of these wrestlers are scheduled to appear on this event. So far, these are:

* Canadian wrestler Starbuck, competing in Europe since 2003, mostly Finland and other Scandinavian countries
* Norwegian wrestler Erik Isaksen, also a veteran of the Scandinavian scene
