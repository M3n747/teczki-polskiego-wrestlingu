"Halloweenowa Rozpierducha" (roughly _Halloween Havoc_, or _Halloween Eff-Up_) was a show by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). The show was announced in a Facebook post alongside [Totalna Anihilacja](@/e/ptw/2025-11-15-ptw-totalna-anihilacja.md). It was the second Halloween-themed show, following 2024's [Underground 23](@/e/ptw/2024-10-19-ptw-underground-23.md).

## Build up

* Over the previous months PTW was building towards the match between the teams led by the two Chairmen. While [Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) already had his team of [Nietykalni](@/tt/nietykalni.md), [Łukasz Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md) was busy recruiting his men. After [Ból Istnienia](@/e/ptw/2025-09-28-ptw-bol-istnienia.md), Team Okoński was finally completed with the addition of [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md) and [Sigma Boy xD](@/w/sigma-boy.md). Thus, a 4 on 4 match was confirmed for the next show.
* On 13.10.2025 PTW announced [Daniel Razor's](@/w/daniel-razor.md) Open Challenge for the [PTW Underground Championship](@/c/ptw-underground-championship.md).
* On 14.10.2025, Pawłowski [confirmed][konfirmacja] the stakes for the 4 on 4 match. If Team Okoński wins, all the members earn title shots. If they lose, however, they will be forever banned from competing for gold. It is unclear whether the stakes extend to all PTW titles, or only the ones that each of Team Okoński's members is recently going after.
* On 15.10.2025 PTW announced [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md) vs [Polski Niedźwiedź](@/w/polski-niedzwiedz.md).
* On 16.10.2025 PTW announced CJ Klakson is going to host an open challenge, where he's going to deliver his signature _manto_ (roughly "beatdown").
* On 19.10.2025 PTW announced Andi ZickZack vs Nic Wesker in a Halloween Hardcore Match.
* On 20.10.2025 PTW announced the return of [Sawicki](@/w/sawicki.md), who made his PTW debut at [Złoto Dla Zuchwałych](@/e/ptw/2025-06-28-ptw-zloto-dla-zuchwalych.md).
* On 21.10.2025 PTW announced an International Showcase Tag Team Match between the British team The Lancadores (Kenny B. & M.R.D.) vs Italians Ivan Sanzio & Davide Adami of Street Creed.
* On 23.10.2025 PTW officially confirmed the main event: Team Okoński ([Łukasz Okoński](@/w/lukasz-okonski.md), [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md), [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md) & [Sigma Boy xD](@/w/sigma-boy.md)) vs [Nietykalni](@/tt/nietykalni.md) ([Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md), [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md) & [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md)) in a 4 vs 4 Elimination Match.

## Recap

* Street Creed worked the match as heels, whereas The Lancadores (with their manager Tori Fox) played babyfaces
* Post-match, the heels tried to put an exclamation mark on their victory, continuing the beatdown on The Lancadores. Tori Fox thwarted their attempts, disposing of both Street Creed members
* Damian Adler, a Polish competitor trained in Germany, made his debut as Pawłowski's handpicked opponent for Razor's Open Challenge. Adler worked the match as a heel, working a blend of powerhouse style and agility. Razor won with a crucifix pin to retain
* Sawicki made his entrance wearing a skull mask with facepaint underneath, playing up the Halloween theme of the show. His entrance mimicked La Parka.
* Pawłowski entered to pick his opponent, teasing Boguś (working as timekeeper) that this is his chance. However, the one to debut was a fellow PTW rookie, Bumper. Sawicki disposed of him in a quick fashion
* Andi Zick Zack won a Halloween Hardcore Match
* The show goes to a break
* After the break, Okoński (accompanied by a scantily-clad woman introduced as Dominika) enters to host a traditional charity auction
* Shida makes an entrance wearing a mask from _Scream_. Polski Niedźwiedź made his entrance as usual. Shida wins in a fairly short match, focusing on mutual respect. Him and Bear embrace afterwards
* Klakson's Manto Challenge turns out to be a Triple Threat Match against two debuting international wrestlers: Dylan Thorn from Scotland and Shawn Aster from [Aruba island][https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aruba]
* Klakson wins in a fairly short fashion hitting a _Polski Przekręt_(roughly: Polish Swindle, a _Twist of Fate_ variation) on Thorn for a pinfall.
* Damian Lambert makes an entrance for unannounced segment. He laments the turn from predator to victim after the previous show. Because of this he can't even looks people in the eyes.
* Pawłowski comes out to choose Lambert's opponent. After once again teasing Boguś with an opportunity, he introduces a fellow rookie, Dropper. Lambert with a quick statement win. Afterwards, Lambert makes an exit, visibly avoiding any eye contact with the audience.
* Nietykalni make an entrance first as a unit. Members of Team Okoński make their entrances in succession.
* In a slightly comedic fashion, Caravaggio uses the ring of his _Granny Matylda_. The only effect it achieves is breaking down a set of chairs placed close to the stage
* Order of eliminations:
*   Pawłowski eliminates Sigma Boy xD after a Wylew from Puncher and some offense of his own
*   Puncher eliminates Okoński after _Wylew_ and a _Curb Stomp_
*   Spartan eliminates Alex Brave after a _Spartan Bomb_
*   Lopez turns on Spartan, hitting him with a chair. Thus, Starboy is eliminated by DQ
*   Puncher eliminates Spartan picking up a win for his team
* After Nietykalni win, Nano Lopez embraces them and celebrates together, thus joining the faction.
