#### Build-up

* Kawaleria vs Sojusz was built around the storyline of KPW's entire locker room being split in two factions: either
  the heel faction Kawaleria (_Cavalry_) led by Piękny Kawaler, or the face faction Sojusz (_Alliance_), led by
  Robert Star.
* Initially, Robert hesitated to join, but after the post-event brawl at [Arena 9](@/e/kpw/2018-03-10-kpw-arena-9-na-krawedzi.md), when he
  defended Mira from being attacked with a taser by Kawaleria, everyone of the faces joined.
* Robert became #1 Contender for the KPW Championship at Arena 9, when Greg lost by DQ. On this event, he would face the undefeated Kawaler for the championship.
* Ron Corvus won the Magnificent Seven Match at the previous year's [Godzina Zero](@/e/kpw/2017-08-12-kpw-godzina-zero-2017.md), for a shot at any of the championships. At Arena 9, Corvus reminded Greg that he's coming for his title.
* On Facebook, Kawaler announced that Kaszub is discharged from his faction. He would never again appear for KPW, likely retiring from wrestling altogether.

#### Recap

- Two new girls in catsuits accompany Moloch to the ring. One of them will later make an in-ring debut as [Diana](@/w/diana-strong.md).
- Ditching the old persona of Kowalski, Mateusz Kakareko became more aggressive, using a Taekwondo-based style, and broke his losing streak.
- Greg "christened" members of the Kawaleria stable by spitting watter on them. This would later become part of his character.
- Kamil Aleksander's mother was present, and Kamil gave her a rose for Mother's Day (May 26th in Poland)
- Zasada was eliminated first, then Kamil Aleksander. With the balance now favouring Team Greg, Adam Bravo pulls out a betrayal by laying down for a pin, showing his middle fingers to Kawaleria.
- Pannache eliminated Rosetti, but ultimately Dawid had to face Greg and Sawicki alone.
- Kawaler delays the match with a very long entry in his new gear, preceded by a body double decoy in his previous attire. Greg would copy this later.
- Bianca interrupted the opening gong with her music. Grabbed the mic to present a counter to Kawaler's blackmail photos: some of her own, depicting his private parties. These showed him and Greg, in a naughty position, both wearing skirts. Audience giggled at the fuming, embarassed heels. Bianca forced both to swear an oath to never again try blackmailing her.
- Lumberjacks ensured that Kawaler cannot flee the ring easily, as is his tactic. Same for Robert, who is also roughed up each time. Random group brawls ensued.
- Ref bump by Kawaler denies Robert a win by submission. Later, Kawaler hits a chairshot, but ref is unable to count past two.
- Kawaler invites his butler Chemik to start pouring out vodka, but Ron Corvus interrupts.
- In the scramble, Moloch briefly fought Gracjan Korpo. They would have a proper fight on the next event.
- Corvus cleared the ring by piledriving members of Kawaleria one at a time. Kawaler is dragged into the ring by force. One powerbomb through a table later, we have a new KPW Champion, ending Kawaler's reign.
