Zagrożenie Lawinowe (_Avalanche Warning_) is an upcoming event by [KPW](@/o/kpw.md).
The event's name refers to the nickname of WxW wrestler Robert "The Avalanche" Dreissker, who is set to appear on the show.

#### Storylines

* Leon Lato is on the rise after an excellent fight at the previous event, almost grabbing the KPW Championship from Red Scorpion. Dawid Oliwa is on a losing streak, and not his usual happy self. Both have something to prove.
* GREG needs to show he's ready to reclaim the KPW Championship, by facing the well-traveled veteran Dreissker.
* At Arena 23, a post-match brawl occured involving the Gregorian Branch faction against the Fux Brothers, Lato, Zefir and others. Chemik challenged the brothers to defend their belts, and boss Krystian Malinowski quickly sanctioned the match.
* More than a year ago, Darius defeated 3 other opponents for a shot at the KPW OldTown Championship. At Arena 20 he declined to fight Rosetti just after the opening gong. But the same night he beat Leon Lato in singles competition. Now he gets his chance.
