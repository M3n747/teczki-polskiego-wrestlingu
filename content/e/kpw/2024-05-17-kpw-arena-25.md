Odkupienie (_Absolution_) is an upcoming event by [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md). It will take place on Friday, May 17th 2024, in [Klub Nowy Harem](@/v/atlantic-nh-gdynia.md) in Gdynia.

The poster for this event strongly references the Hitman series of games. On a red background, we see the back of a bald man's head. The head presumably belongs to [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md), and has a barcode tattoed over it. By reading it with an appriopriate app, we can discover it's a CODE128 barcode, encoding text that reads "Chemik". The font choice is also similar to the game covers. However, while the game protagonist is indeed bald and has a barcode, none of the covers show the back of his head.

Foreign wrestlers performing at this event are:

* Austrian wrestler Martn Pain, in his second appearance for KPW. He has another connection to the Polish wrestling scene: two matches in PTW's Austrian [sister promotion](@/o/ptw.md#expansion-into-austria), one of them against [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md).
* English wrestler Louis Basham, competing for Coventry-based UKPW and other British organizations.
* Hungarian heavyweight Gulyas Öcsi. While this is his first match in Poland, he already faced against some Polish wrestlers on the German and Hungarian scenes, though none from KPW.

### Build-up and stories leading to the event

* Back in [2020](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16-polowanie.md), Austrian wrestler Martn Pain unsuccessfully challenged champion Dawid Oliwa for the KPW OldTown belt. A second loss is not in the cards for him.
* Dawid Oliwa keeps losing his matches, and keeps blaming it on everyone else. His latest chance to redeem himself is in a match against British up-and-comer Louis Basham.
* A hoss fight is coming: between the huge Gulyas Öcsi and equally massive Eryk Lesak. Both are billed as brawlers with nothing to lose and much to prove.
* Greg needs another victory before he can think of reclaiming the KPW Championship belt, after he failed to defeat Robert Dreissker. So far, the Fux brothers managed to defeat his minions. Can Filip defeat him?
