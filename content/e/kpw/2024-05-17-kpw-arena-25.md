Odkupienie (_Absolution_) is an upcoming event by [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md). It will take place on Friday, May 17th 2024, in [Klub Nowy Harem](@/v/atlantic-nh-gdynia.md) in Gdynia.

The poster for this event strongly references the Hitman series of games. On a red background, we see the back of a bald man's head. The head presumably belongs to [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md), and has a barcode tattoed over it. By reading it with an appriopriate app, we can discover it's a CODE128 barcode, encoding text that reads "Chemik". The font choice is also similar to the game covers. However, while the game protagonist is indeed bald and has a barcode, none of the covers show the back of his head.
