Powrót Do Przyszłości (_Back To The Future_) was KPW's 18th Arena show, and the second post-pandemic one, after another 7-month long hiatus. This time, the show's name
references that they are back in a place from their past: the former Klub Atlantic (which held Arenas [5](@/e/kpw/2017-01-14-kpw-arena-v.md), [6](@/e/kpw/2017-04-08-kpw-arena-6-selekcja.md) and [7](@/e/kpw/2017-06-10-kpw-arena-7-wysoka-stawka.md)) which has been rebranded and redecorated as Nowy Harem.

For this event, KPW invited the well-traveled Maltese wrestler Gianni Valletta, Italian masked wrestler Red Scorpion, and high-flying Austrian wrestler of Iranian descent Darius.
Ron Corvus, last seen at [Arena 14](@/e/kpw/2019-06-15-kpw-arena-14-nastepny-poziom.md) also returned to KPW after 3 years.

#### Build-up

* In Zefir's promo, we saw him sitting at a bonfire, and humming the melody from Four Takn-Men and a Dog (Czterej Pancerni i pies), an extremely popular, black and white TV series from the 60s. Zefir reminisced about his loss to Rosetti, and cast photos of his two opponents into the fire.
* Greg, appearing in his long monasterial robes, declared that facing Corvus is his Via Crucis. In his promo we saw cuts to a past, younger, more aggressive Greg holding the KPW OldTown belt. Greg seemed to confront his younger self.
* Gianni Valletta told the viewers he already saw Dawid Oliwa fight in Malta. Indeed, in February that same year Dawid faced Red Scorpion and Adam Envy in an event by Pro Wrestling Malta. On that same event, Gianni Valletta fought Zak Knight, a future one-time KPW competitor.
* Ron Corvus considered his upcoming fight with Greg a rematch from [five years ago](@/e/kpw/2017-02-04-kpw-szlamfest.md), which he won. On the day of the event, Corvus planned to do three things: swim in the sea, beat Greg again, and drink a lot of _piwo_ (beer).
* Lesak was certain that his loss to the Fux brothers at Arena 17 was solely the fault of the incompetent Piotr Opolski. He announced that Rosetti is going to be his partner. 
* Boski 2.0 won a contract to challenge for a championship at Godzina Zero 2019. However, he's since retired from wrestling.

#### Recap and aftermath

* Rosetti no-showed Lesak, who announced that he will now face the brothers alone.
* After taking a frog splash and escaping a pin, Lesak left the ring, flipping the bird at his opponents and the ref, which led to a count-out.
* Chemik entered carrying a wooden cross to the ring, and referenced the vows he made at the previous event. During the fight, Rosetti appeared, unaware that he missed his scheduled appeareance, which distracted the ref enough for Chemik to perform a backstabber and Last Rites to grab his first win.
