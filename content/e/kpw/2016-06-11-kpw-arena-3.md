#### Recap

- Greg enters in a bad mood because his entrance music is missing. Dawid is distracted by Luxus.
- During the second match, Lambert pops out from under the ring holding a chair. Zasada tries to stop him, only to get some chair in his face. Pannache cowers,
  ready for the chairshot but Korpo receives it instead, leading to a DQ. A second chair does land on Pannache while he was talking to the referee.
- Greg intervenes and attacks Mira. She retaliates by slapping him, and Ostrowski lands a suicide dive on Greg. Luxus wants Greg to restrain his opponent,
  but Mira intervenes again with a low-blow. Luxus pins, but Greg distracts the ref who starts the count late.
- Kamil returns after suspension, applies various locks and holds to his opponent. Lambert does a Three Amigos on Kamil, but loses to a Semper Invictus.
- Kawaler starts in the ring with his faction, and cuts a promo on Robert, promising the same result as [three years ago](@/e/ddw/2013-10-25-ddw-9.md).
  Bianca enters in a sexy referee outfit. Robert enters with KISS-inspired face paint on. Robert applies a Sharpshooter, but is distracted by a masked character
  at ringside. Superkicks him for good measure, but this allows Kawaler to recover and pin Robert. The masked character turns out to be Leśny.
