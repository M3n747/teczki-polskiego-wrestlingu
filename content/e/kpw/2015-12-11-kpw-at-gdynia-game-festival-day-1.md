Gdynia Game Festival was primarily an e-sports event, accompanied by robotics workshops, several talks about modern technologies, and even cosplay shows, held in 2015. While there were plans for follow-up editions, ultimately only one was ever held.

KPW held exhibition shows on all three days of the festival. Their ring was reused for other events, including robotic combat. KPW would later reprise this idea by appearing on the yearly [Pyrkon][pyrkon] fan convention.
