Arena 13 was held on Apr 5 2019 in Gdynia Sports Center. The event's name, an Italian phrase associated with the Mafia, meaning _Boss of all the Bosses_, is a reference to the fact that KPW would finally select their new Chairman persona on this event, closing this storyline. It would also see the first ever title defense of the new Tag Team Championship.

Originally, the tag team champions were scheduled against German wrestlers Fynn Freyhart and Vincent Heisenberg.

### Stories leading to the event

* In a promo released before the event, Rosetti mockedly named their opponents as Fynn Frajerheart (_frajer_ being the word for loser) and Vincent Heineken while raising a bottle of the same, with a faux German accent. This was followed by more references to Germany and war crimes. At the end, Sawicki smashes the green beer bottle against a wall, calling it "fucking German piss". Heineken is a Dutch beer company.
* In another promo, Chairman candidate Krzysztof Zasada withdrew himself, giving his support to candidate Malinowski.
* Yet another promo, recorded in a horror style, featured the future Diana calling Moloch unbeatable in a solo fight. Peter Pannache would be the next one to challenge that claim.

### Recap

* Gracjan lost after Moloch appeared at ringside. The two were supposed to be tag team partners at Arena 11, and are now feuding.
* After Dawid's match, current champion Greg appeared, followed later by Ostrowski, Oliwa's former partner. Heated words and punches were exchanged.
* Bianca announced the vote count for the new Chairman: Kawaler and Malinowski with 26 votes each. Her vote was now deciding, and she cast it for Malinowski.
* Sawicki bled visibly during the tag team match.
* Robert is still wearing Kawaleria's facepaint.
* After Robert won the belt, Kawaler, still in his Chairman Candidate suit, appeared and requested Robert to hand over the belt, attacking and mock-pinning him. Robert
  retaliated with a Rockstar Hangover.
* This would be the final KPW event to feature Pawłowski.
