Oko za Oko (_Eye for an eye_) was KPW's second show of 2022 and the 19th Arena show overall, held in the Nowy Harem music club. We saw the return of Fynn Freyhart and Darius.

Originally German wrestler Martn Pain was to face Greg and Darius in a three way match. Unfortunately, Martn had to bow out due to ilness.

#### Recap

* Filip Fux entered holding a rolled banner. The banner, when unrolled (and displayed on the stage LED screen as well) was a mock photoshopped poster of Steve Carell's _40 year old virgin_ movie, but with Chemik's face and age (23) replaced. After the fight, Chemik attempted to poke Filip's eye out with a long screwdriver, which resulted in some light bleeding from the forehead.
* Kawaleria (_Cavalry_) was disbanded at Godzina Zero 2019, with Greg's surprise betrayal of Kawaler. Now under Greg's leadership, it was reborn as Gałąź Gregoriańska (_Gregorian Branch_), counting Chemik, Rosetti and Eryk Lesak in its members.
* Greg delivered his sermon from the ring, where he announced he's not going to exert himself as he only cares for the upcoming Godzina Zero. Then he performed a ceremony to swear in a new tag team of Lesak and Chemik.
* With the ref distracted, Greg put on his signet ring, and punched Darius to win.
* Freyhart scored the first pinfall. Dawid's victory was interrupted by the Gregorian Branch. Greg, waving a soft penis-shaped candy from his crotch, attempts to "feed" it to Dawid, who's held down by Rosetti. The Fux Brothers and Zefir interfere to help Dawid and Fynn.
