The second Arena event was a return to Gdańsk, and the same venue that held DDW's last three shows. Kawaler's heel faction Kawaleria (_Cavalry_) dominated the show.

#### Recap

- During a ringside altercation between Zasada and Mira, Korpo is hit with a briefcase to the head, later wants to hit Zasada with a Deadline, but only pushes him away.
  Fans cheer the mistreated manager.
- Lambert was to face Kamil Aleksander, who got suspended after Kawaler revealed some controversial information. Cuts a promo belittling the entire locker room,
  and asks for a new opponent to face. Peter Pannache debuts with his "Hańba!" (_Dishonor!_) catchphrase to great reactions.
- Corvus dominates early, but Kawaler's faction intervenes and draws him backstage. Reappears beaten up, and Kawaler takes control of the match.
- KPW's first ladder match ever with forming temporary tag teams. Robert bleeds from a ladder hit, while Kawaler intervenes and denies Kaszub the win. Robert drops him
  from the top of the ladder with a Rockstar Hangover, then climbs it and grabs the contract.
