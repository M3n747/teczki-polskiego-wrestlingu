The sixth Arena show, was held once again in Klub Atlantic, a music venue in Gdynia.

This event featured the wrestling debut of Karol Górski in a squash match against [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md), followed by beatings administered by the Kawaleria faction.
Karol would later appear in [MZW](@/e/2017-12-02-mzw-freak-show.md) that same year.
Several years later, he became [Iskra](@/w/iskra.md) in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), debuting at [PTW Underground 6]. This makes him the only wrestler to appear for all three of these organizations.

#### Recap

* During the main event, wrestlers brawl out into the audience, and up the stairs to the mezzanine level. [Greg](@/w/greg.md) fights with Ostrowski, each trying to throw the other over the barriers. Ostrowski takes the dive, landing on everybody else to chants of "Holy Sh*t" from the audience.
