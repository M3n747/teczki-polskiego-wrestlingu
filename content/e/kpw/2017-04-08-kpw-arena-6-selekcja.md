The sixth Arena show, was held once again in Klub Atlantic, a music venue in Gdynia.

This event featured the wrestling debut of Karol Górski in a squash match against Piękny Kawaler, followed by beatings administered by the Kawaleria faction.
Karol would later appear in [MZW](@/e/2017-12-02-mzw-freak-show.md) that same year.
Several years later, he became [Iskra](@/w/iskra.md) in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), debuting at [PTW Underground 6]. This makes him the only wrestler to appear for all three of these organizations.
