Na Krawędzi (_On The Edge_) was held as part of the second SzlamFest. In terms of KPW history, it was a regular Arena show, continuing the storylines from Arena 8. The main event was probably the most bloody hardcore match ever held by KPW.

This show was also the debut of the future Chemik - who appeared as a personal butler to Kawaler. Before the women's match, the Kawaleria faction installed themselves at comfy ringside seats and remained there for the rest of the evening, while the butler kept pouring vodka for them and some lucky members of the audience.

#### Recap

* The first match was slated to have three tag teams face each other. Rosetti's partner
  Sawicki was unable to compete, so the cocky heel entered the fight solo, but with
  Kaszub and Alisa at ringside. Lots of aerial action.
* Before the women's match, Kawaler cut his usual promo deriding the audience. Alisa gave
  Bianca a tough fight.
* Korpo faced Corvus in a rematch from Godzina Zero 2016. In his promo, he ridiculed
  Corvus for growing a beer belly instead of preparing for their fight.
* Greg and Kaszub initially jumped at each other's throats, but once the gong hit, they reenacted the Fingerpoke of Doom match. Kawaleria entered the ring to celebrate.
* Pawłowski announced the result, then disappeared backstage. Shortly after, reappered and announced a new opponent for Greg.
* Oliwa and Greg fight with light tubes, chairs, ladders, Lego bricks and a keyboard. Plenty of blood from both. Ron Corvus intervened to remind Greg he's coming for his championship.
* Once the bell rang, Kawaleria attacked the bleeding Dawid, to be countered by the faces, who now form a faction called Sojusz (_Alliance_). Kawaler and Greg tried to attack Mira with a taser, but were stopped by Robert Star.
