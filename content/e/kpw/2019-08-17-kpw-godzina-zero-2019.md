The fourth Godzina Zero (_Hour Zero_) show was KPW's biggest event in 2019. It was held again in the Gdynia Sports Center, following that year's two-week long wrestling school camp.

A total of six foreign guest wrestlers were invited to perform. One was the returning Swedish female wrestler Sixt, who appeared on the 2018 edition against Bianca. Another gguest from Sweden was Steinbolt, who was part of a tag team with Spanish (although competing in Denmark and Scandinavia) wrestler Carlos Zamora. From Canada, another wrestler with Polish roots and some command of the language was the powerhouse Reinbakh. From the British scene, Dom Taylor returned yet again.

The biggest name invited was however, British wrestler Primate, by the time signed to NXT UK as part of a tag team with Wild Boar (who appeared at [Godzina Zero 2017](@/e/kpw/2017-08-12-kpw-godzina-zero-2017.md)). Both were yet to appear as a team in KPW. The previous year, Primate announced his retirement due to an extremely serious medical condition: a minor jaw fracture that went unnoticed. While wrestling with that fracture, he managed to develop infection in his bones, which turned into a full jaw fracture on one side. This was career-ending. Howeve, after 7 months of inactivity, Primate managed to return to wrestling.

Like in previous years, a _Magnificent Seven_ ladder match was held, whose winner received a contract to challenge anyone of the current champions for their title, anytime. This match saw the debut of two new KPW wrestlers: Daniel Boza and Eryk Lesak. Last year's winner Peter Pannache was also scheduled to appear. At the event, we learned that he chose to step down for personal reasons, and was replaced by Greg, who pulled double duty that night.

In the woman's match, we got another debut: Diana, who previously served as one of Moloch's valets, speaking on his promos, and occassionally doing interviewer duty.

#### Build-up

* Kawaler challenged Robert Star for his title and career. According to him, Robert was ungrateful, after Kawaleria helped him win the title belt, he refused to hand it over to Kawaler.
* Sixt wants to avenge her defeat and restore honor, as a proud Swedish shieldmaiden. This time, she'd have to contend not just with Bianca, but with Alisa and the debuting Diana as well.
* Kamil Aleksander was kept in the dark on the identity of his opponent. So were the fans. Only in a [promo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2EgpkNPn04) released two weeks before the event did they learn his face, but not his name.
* Ostrowski has now completely turned heel, after his attacks on former partner Dawid Oliwa. He would now wear different gear and ditch his old disco theme.

#### Aftermath

* This was Moloch's last match in KPW, although he was booked for the following event.
* When Kawaler's music hit, Greg instead walked out, and spoke in Latin: "Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum; habemus Papam" (_I announce to you with great joy: we have a Pope_). This is the traditional announced when the papal Conclave has successfully selected a new Pope. Then he continued with "Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinalem: Kawaler" and left the ring.
* Kawaler appeared on a balcony like a priest before the pulpit, wearing long hooded robes and delivered a sermon deriding Robert Star and announcing the end of his career.
* After the main event, Kawaler offered his hand to Robert, who reluctantly accepted the handshake. Kawaler then lifted Robert's arm in a victory pose, only to land a surprise kick seconds later. Wrestlers present at ringside: Bianca, Reinbakh, Dawid Oliwa and Kamil Aleksander intervened, punishing Kawaler and delivering their signature moves to him. They struck a victory pose with Kawaler literally under Robert's heel.
* Behind their backs, Greg entered the ring and helped Kawaler. However, to everyone's surpise, instead of helping him off the ring, he landed a surprise attack, betraying Kawaler.
* When the announcer was closing the show, she was interrupted by some coughing. This turned out to be Chemik, standing on the same balcony that Kawaler delivered his speech from. He repeated the _Annuntio vobis_ phrase, this time naming Greg as the bishop of Rome. Greg entered the pulpit, to Ghost BC's Year Zero. Announced himself as the new pope of Polish wrestling, under the name Pijus I Greg (pijus being a pun on both Pius, a name of many Popes, but also the Polish word for _drunkard_).
