The fourth Godzina Zero (_Hour Zero_) show was KPW's biggest event in 2019. It was held again in the Gdynia Sports Center, following that year's two-week long wrestling school camp.

A total of six foreign guest wrestlers were invited to perform. One was the returning Swedish female wrestler Sixt, who appeared on the 2018 edition against Bianca. Another gguest from Sweden was Steinbolt, who was part of a tag team with Spanish (although competing in Denmark and Scandinavia) wrestler Carlos Zamora. From Canada, another wrestler with Polish roots and some command of the language was the powerhouse Reinbakh. From the British scene, Dom Taylor returned yet again.

The biggest name invited was however, British wrestler Primate, by the time signed to NXT UK as part of a tag team. He would return next year with his partner Wild Boar. The previous year, Primate announced his retirement due to an extremely serious medical condition: a minor jaw fracture that went unnoticed. While wrestling with that fracture, he managed to develop infection in his bones, which turned into a full jaw fracture on one side. This was career-ending. Howeve, after 7 months of inactivity, Primate managed to return to wrestling.

Like in previous years, a _Magnificent Seven_ ladder match was held, whose winner received a contract to challenge anyone of the current champions for their title, anytime. This match saw the debut of two new KPW wrestlers: Daniel Boza and Eryk Lesak.

In the woman's match, we got another debut: Diana, who previously served as one of Moloch's valets, speaking on his promos, and occassionally doing interviewer duty.

#### Build-up

* Kawaler challenged Robert Star for his title and career. According to him, Robert was ungrateful, after Kawaleria helped him win the title belt, he refused to hand it over to Kawaler.
* Sixt wants to avenge her defeat and restore honor, as a proud Swedish shieldmaiden. This time, she'd have to contend not just with Bianca, but with Alisa and the debuting Diana as well.
* Kamil Aleksander was kept in the dark on the identity of his opponent. So were the fans. Only in a [promo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2EgpkNPn04) released two weeks before the event did they learn his face, but not his name.
