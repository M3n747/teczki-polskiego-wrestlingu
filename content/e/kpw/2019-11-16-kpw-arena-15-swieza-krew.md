Świeża Krew (_Fresh Blood_) was the 15th Arena show by [KPW](@/o/kpw.md), held at Gdynia Sports Center on November 16, 2019. The event's name refers to new wrestlers debuting in their solo fights: Daniel Boza and Eryk Lesak (although the two appeared in the Magnificent Seven ladder match before).

#### Build-up

* Originally, Chemik was to face Moloch. However, on the day of the event, KPW posted on facebook that Moloch was injured, and cannot appear. Chemik's new opponent would be revealed during the event.
* Piękny Kawaler lost his career at the previous Godzina Zero event to Robert Star. He would no longer wrestle for KPW, remaining active as trainer and owner of the organization. In August, after Godzina Zero, he left for Romania as a trainer, and appear in two matches there.
* Previously Greg took on a new persona of self-proclaimed Pope of Polish Wrestling, Pijus I Greg. Chemik now also ditched his butler persona, and appears dressed like an altar boy.
* Now fully turned heel, with new gear and entrance music, Boski 2.0 has a score to settle with Dawid Oliwa.
* Tag Team Champions Sawicki and Rosetti began to lose trust in each other.
