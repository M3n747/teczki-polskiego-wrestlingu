"Co Za Noc" (_What a Night_) was an event announced on 10.09.2024, and held on Saturday, October 26th 2024 by [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md). It took place in a brand new venue - a post-industrial complex at Mińska 65 in Warsaw.

Just like most of PpW's bigger shows, this event was streamed live on their YouTube channel for free.

The name of the show comes from a viral [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/k0nnjEmVHWs?t=157) published by Polish influencer Robert Pasut, and become a popular running joke and a sort of a catchphrase among PpW's fans and workers, roughly since [PpW Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md).

### Build-up

* PpW announced a collaboration event for the show. Before and during the event, there will be an opportunity to get a tattoo, courtesy of tattoo parlour Syrena (_Siren_).
* To further bolster ticket sales, PpW introduced a student discount as well are "buy 5, get 1 free" discount.
* Many PpW personalities announced new merchandise items to be available at the show.

#### Storylines overview

* A huge part of the show revolved around the main conflict of two groups: the villainous ["Zmowa"](@/a/the-collusion.md) led by [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), and "Zmowa przeciwko zmowie" led by [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md).
  Nearly a year-long feud of Mister Z versus Biesiad, as well as many other additional conflicts such as Pure Gold vs Legia Łysych, finally imploded at [Hardcore Friday 2](@/e/ppw/2024-09-20-ppw-hardcore-friday-2.md), after Biesiad and his allies challenged "Zmowa" for an "Ustawka Match", which was a 5 vs 5 Elimination No Holds Barred tag team match.
* [Samson](@/w/samson.md) continued his rivalry with [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md).
  After their non-title match at [Hardcore Friday X4](@/e/ppw/2024-08-23-ppw-hardcore-friday-x4.md) ended in a draw, and losing to a team of Gustav and Isnorr in the Anarchy Cyclone Tag Team Match at [Hardcore Friday 2](@/e/ppw/2024-09-20-ppw-hardcore-friday-2.md),
  Samson was eager to challenge Gustav for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) in a strap match - the same weapon Gustav used to choke Samson during Hardcore Friday 2.
* [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md) continued his crusade in the ultraviolent division, going up against [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md).
  This story goes back to [Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md), where Isnorr intervened in Blade's match.
  The rivalry later continued with Isnorr challenging Johnny for the [PpW European Ultraviolent Championship](@/c/ppw-european-ultraviolent-championship.md) at [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md), only to be defeated.
  Isnorr then won the Insane Wheel of Fortune Gauntlet Invitational Match hosted by Blade, and later defeated him in a tag team match at Hardcore Friday 2, earning his opportunity to challange the champion for a rematch.
* After their match at [Ale Grzeje](@/e/ppw/2024-07-13-ppw-ale-grzeje.md) was cancelled due to [Alex Arthur](@/w/alex-arthur.md) other obligations, him and [Feager](@/w/feager.md) were set to finally compete in a chairs match at "Co Za Noc".
