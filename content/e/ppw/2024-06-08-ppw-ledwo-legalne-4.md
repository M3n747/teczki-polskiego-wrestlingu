Ledwo Legalne IV (_Barely Legal_) is an upcoming event by [PPW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md), scheduled for Saturday, June 8th 2024. The venue announced is Praga Centrum, a music and event venue in Warsaw's east-side Praga district. This is the same venue that hosted [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md).

### Build-up

Based on the poster, and outcomes of the [previous show](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md) the show may feature:

* Stanisław van Dobroniak defending his Ultraviolent Championship against Johnny Blade and Alex Arthur.
* Goblin vs Gustav Gryffin in a no holds barred match, with a title shot at the PPW Championship at stake
* As per Mister Z's interview, not yet announced on Facebook: Biesiad Strong vs Mister Z vs Feager(c) for the PPW Championship

On Saturday May 11, 2024, the day when [PTW](@/o/ptw.md) held their [event](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) in Legionowo near Warsaw, PpW's Facebook page posted about booking [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) for the show. Robert's career in Poland was always connected to promotions run by or with some influence of PTW's owner Arkadiusz Pawłowski.

#### Storylines overview

* In the aftermath of Gustav Gryffin vs Goblin at [Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md), Goblin has moved on, while Gustav became obsessed with his unexpected loss. At [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md), his frustration reached a critical point, leading to him attacking Goblin, stealing his prize from the 420 Critical Ladder Match.
During the mid-show interviews, both wrestlers declared their plans to go for the PPW title, and to face each other.
Later that night, after Gryffin's attempt to interfere in Feager v Mister Z on the latter's behalf, Goblin disposed of Gustav, taking him out of the ring and brawling to the outside. Their upcoming match was announced on PpW's facebook page on May 6th 2024.
* After losing a tag team main event at [Czyste Intencje](@/e/ppw/2023-09-09-ppw-czyste-intencje.md) in 2023, Johnny Blade was banned from challenging for the PpW European Ultraviolent Championship.
At the same time, Biesiad was banned from competing for the PpW Championship which he previously held. \
At [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md), in the aftermath of Feager v Mister Z which featured a referee bump, [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) became the only available referee able to officiate the Deathmatch main event. He brokered a "deal" with [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), who had no choice but to lift Johnyy's titleshot ban if he wanted the main event to happen. \
The championship match saw Johnny strongly biased in favor of challenger Alex Arthur. Eventually, Dobroniak overcame both the referee and the challenger, counting his pin with the motionless Johnny's hand. Post-show, both Blade and Arthur declared in their respective interviews, their intent to face Dobroniak for the title once again - which means that a Triple Threat might be in the books for Ledwo Legalne 4.
* After a long, personal feud, [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) wanted a one on one match against Mister Z, but was always denied the chance. He put his hair on the line against Rambo (working as a "mercenary" for Mister Z) at [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md). His victory earned him a match against Mister Z. \
Meanwhile, Mister Z challenged [Feager](@/w/feager.md) for the PpW Championship and came up short, due to Gustav's interference, thwarted by, among others, Biesiad Strong. \
In his post-show interview, Mister Z (exercising full power over PpW after Mandecky's unfortunate demise) announced his rematch against Feager for the next show, and promised (per the stipulation) a match against Biesiad, to take place simultaneously - as a Triple Threat Match for the PpW Championship. This next show is Ledwo Legalne 4, and the match is all but confirmed to happen there.
