Ledwo Legalne IV (_Barely Legal_) is an upcoming event by [PPW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md), scheduled for Saturday, June 8th 2024. The venue announced is Praga Centrum, a music and event venue in Warsaw's east-side Praga district. This is the same venue that hosted [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md).

Unusually, this show is not going to be streamed live, like previous events. In a [facebook post][facebook-too-violent] PpW stated this was due to excessive violence and insanity that would not be accepted by any streaming portal. However, they also promised to upload select matches after the show's conclusion.

PpW announced a pre-show conference to be held on May 31st 2024 - one week before the show. This event took place in [2koła](@/v/2kola.md), the organization's original venue. Unlike the upcoming show, this event was streamed live. It featured wrestling segments building up to the show, and was followed by an afterparty with PpW's roster members. Refer to the [Pre-show](#pre-show) section for details.

### Build-up

Based on the poster, and outcomes of the [previous show](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md) the show may feature:

* Stanisław van Dobroniak defending his Ultraviolent Championship against Johnny Blade and Alex Arthur.
* Goblin vs Gustav Gryffin in a no holds barred match, with a title shot at the PPW Championship at stake
* Biesiad Strong vs Mister Z vs Feager(c) for the PPW Championship, announced by Z in his interview at [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md#finale)
* On Saturday May 11, 2024, the day when [PTW](@/o/ptw.md) held their [event](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md) in Legionowo near Warsaw, PpW's Facebook page posted about booking [Robert Star](@/w/robert-star.md) for the show. Robert's career in Poland was always connected to promotions run by or with some influence of PTW's owner Arkadiusz Pawłowski.
* Later, it was announced that Robert will face [Samson](@/w/samson.md) in a singles match.

#### Pre-show

The event featured Q&A panels, and face-to-face confrontations between competitors for each upcoming match.
It was moderated by Konrad "Joker" Grześkiewicz and "OG" Michael HT. Joker did commentary and interviews at [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md#finale), while Michael is PpW's ring announcer and mouthpiece.
On a small stage, tables were placed, mimicking a proper press conference setting, but with a unique twist: instead of water, PpW-labeled beer bottles were placed on the tables.

* [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) started first, answering some hard questions, even about their competition ([PTW](@/o/ptw.md)). [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) joined him to also answer some questions. They tried calling the absent [Feager](@/w/feager.md) on the phone, but he declined the call. Face to face on stage, they tried to get physical but were quickly separated.
* [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) was next, and announced that he's facing [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md) for the PpW European Ultraviolent Championship, and that it's going to be a "Born To Be Wired" match. This match type is an ECW tribute, named after their [event][btbw] that featured Terry Funk vs Sabu in a brutal barbed wire match.
* The final segment was between [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) and [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md). After each cut a promo, trash-talking each other, they answered questions from the audience. Gustav was taking audience heat, as most of the "questions" to him were insults from the crowd. To finish their segment, Goblin put Gustav through the table.
* An afterparty followed, with Joker and referee Kornel DJ-ing, playing mostly wrestling entrance themes. PpW wrestlers and staff partied together with the fans, which PpW calls "fanatics".

#### Storylines overview

* In the aftermath of Gustav Gryffin vs Goblin at [Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md), Goblin has moved on, while Gustav became obsessed with his unexpected loss. At [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md), his frustration reached a critical point, leading to him attacking Goblin, stealing his prize from the 420 Critical Ladder Match.
During the mid-show interviews, both wrestlers declared their plans to go for the PPW title, and to face each other.
Later that night, after Gryffin's attempt to interfere in Feager v Mister Z on the latter's behalf, Goblin disposed of Gustav, taking him out of the ring and brawling to the outside. Their upcoming match was announced on PpW's facebook page on May 6th 2024.
* After losing a tag team main event at [Czyste Intencje](@/e/ppw/2023-09-09-ppw-czyste-intencje.md) in 2023, Johnny Blade was banned from challenging for the PpW European Ultraviolent Championship.
At the same time, Biesiad was banned from competing for the PpW Championship which he previously held. \
At [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md), in the aftermath of Feager v Mister Z which featured a referee bump, [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) became the only available referee able to officiate the Deathmatch main event. He brokered a "deal" with [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), who had no choice but to lift Johnyy's title shot ban if he wanted the main event to happen. \
The championship match saw Johnny strongly biased in favor of challenger Alex Arthur. Eventually, Dobroniak overcame both the referee and the challenger, counting his pin with the motionless Johnny's hand. Post-show, both Blade and Arthur declared in their respective interviews, their intent to face Dobroniak for the title once again - which means that a Triple Threat might be in the books for Ledwo Legalne 4.
* After a long, personal feud, [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) wanted a one on one match against Mister Z, but was always denied the chance. He put his hair on the line against Rambo (working as a "mercenary" for Mister Z) at [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md). His victory earned him a match against Mister Z. \
Meanwhile, Mister Z challenged [Feager](@/w/feager.md) for the PpW Championship and came up short, due to Gustav's interference, thwarted by, among others, Biesiad Strong. \
In his post-show interview, Mister Z (exercising full power over PpW after Mandecky's unfortunate demise) announced his rematch against Feager for the next show, and promised (per the stipulation) a match against Biesiad, to take place simultaneously - as a Triple Threat Match for the PpW Championship. This next show is Ledwo Legalne 4, and the match is all but confirmed to happen there.
* Following [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md)'s debut at [Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md), his Pure Gold tag team partner [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) saved him from a beatdown by the defeated [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md). At [Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md), Pure Gold reunited in the ring for the first time since losing their PTW tag titles final match at [PTW#4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md). They faced off against Baklava Club, who beat them down post-match, leaving the door open for a possible rematch. \
For the next show, Pure Gold were left without opponents, and their Open Challenge was announced on [PpW's Facebook page][pure-gold-challenge]
