Ewenement Haze is an upcoming event by [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md), taking place on Saturday April 20.
The original venue was to be [Waldorffa 25](@/v/waldorffa25.md), but due to miscommunication, it turned out that it's already booked for the night, and PpW had to find a replacement.
The new venue is Praga Centrum, which is a music and event venue with a large outdoor garden, located in Warsaw's Praga district.
According to Facebook posts, the ring will be set outdoors, which is a first for PpW.
The event's name refers to cannabis, whose many strains are often named "Something + Haze". This in turn, is a reference to the date, which, together with the number 420 are often associated with cannabis culture.

The foreign guests for this event will be:

* German wrestler Nick Schreier. In 2021, Nick, in his third ever match recorded on Cagematch, appeared for [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) at [Project 8: Golden Road Finals](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md).
* Danish wrestler Benny Bacchus, who competes mostly in Denmark and Sweden

#### Build-up and information released so far

* Six matches are planned for the event
* Mister Z defeated Ricardo Diesel for the #1 Contender spot. PpW Champion Feager defends his newly won title in the main event.
* The 4/20 ladder match
* Stanislaw Van Dobroniak is defending the PpW Ultraviolent championship against Alex Arthur. In a promo released on social media, he compared his opponent to a beaver, referencing a meme.
* Nick Schreier, while not yet announced for the show, leaked his appearance on his Instagram, listing dates and cities of his bookings in April.
* Pure Gold (Gabriel Queen and Vic Golden) are set to appear in a tag team match.
