Teraz Albo Nigdy (_Now Or Never_) is an upcoming event by [PpW Ewenement Wrestling](@/o/ppw.md), set to return to [Mi≈Ñska&nbsp;65](@/v/minska-65.md). This time, the show is set in a different part of the venue complex, _Hala Labo_.

PpW launched the ticket sales exactly two months before the event date. It is the first PpW event to introduce three tiers of tickets, with varying pricing:

* _normal_ &ndash; 85,20 PLN (approx. 20 EUR, 17 GBP or 20.5 USD); grants only entry to the event
* _Fan pack_ &ndash; 159,75 PLN (approx. 37.5 EUR, 32 GBP or 39 USD); entry + commemorative limited edition T-shirt + commemorative autographed poster
* _VIP pack_ &ndash; 213,00 PLN (approx. 50 EUR, 42 GBP or 51.5 USD); entry + special seats (ringside or bleachers) + commemorative limited edition T-shirt + 2 servings of drinks

#### Build-up
* Along with the event, PpW announced "the largest match in PpW history". This match is supposed to contain 20 competitors in a single ring, though the exact formula is as yet unknown.
* [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) and [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) continued to cross paths ever since July. While Olgierd vowed to end Goblin, the latter always found a way to one-up him. At [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) Goblin interfered in a six man tag match, dragging Olgierd away on a dog leash. After weeks of social media build-up, PpW announced they would face-off in Dog Collar Match - the first in Poland.
* On 25.02.2025 PpW [posted][20-ziutkow] the details of the 20-Man Battle Royal:
  - 20 wrestlers will take part in the match.
  - The fight begins with two people in the ring.
  - A new wrestler enters every 90 seconds.
  - Wrestlers are eliminated by being thrown over the top rope; both feet must touch the floor.
  - Each wrestler may bring one weapon.
  - The winner will fight for the [PpW Championship](@/c/ppw-championship.md) at Ledwo Legalne 5.
