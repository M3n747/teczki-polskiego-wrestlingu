The show was announced in the closing segment of [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), with tickets immediately available for purchase at the merch table.

## Build-up
* On February 10th, PpW posted a video of [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) challenging [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) for a match with any stipulation of Blade's choosing - except for his signature Hardcore Match.
* The match was confirmed the following day in PpW's social media.
* [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) also confirmed that while Johnny's suspension is lifted, [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) is still suspended and he is going to get something "special" at the show.
* On February 13th, Johnny Blade posted a video of himself tending bar at [2Koła](@/v/2kola.md) - his day job, now openly acknowledged in PpW storylines. While pouring vodka shots, he presents his choice of stipulation - a _Drunken Ambition Match_, or _Gra w melanż_. The rules are simple - whoever grabs the rope, needs to drink a shot of vodka. Later in the day PpW confirmed the match, officially naming the stipulation _Gra w melanż - wódka mecz_ (roughly "Party Game - Vodka Match").
* On 16.02.2025 PpW announced that Biesiad would have to face Mister Z's "special challenge" to earn his way back from his suspension.
* The day after that since [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) decided to go to Mexico instead of appearing at [Hardcore Friday 2](@/e/ppw/2024-09-20-ppw-hardcore-friday-2.md), he'd now have to compete in a "lucha surprise" match.
* On 18.02.2025 [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) was announced.

#### Recap

* This was the first PpW event to be streamed live at the [PpW VOD][ppw-vod], after the [previous show](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) experienced technical difficulties and streamed on YouTube instead.
* The live stream went offline a few times during the show, including the final minutes of the opening match.
* Mister Z defeated Marcelito in 2:47, thus setting a time limit for Biesiad to defeat Sambor.
* The Vodka Match appeared to end in a double drunk-out, but Johnny Blade managed to get up to his feet, thus securing the win.
* Since all three referees fought in the main event, the special guest referee for the match was [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md).
* Marco came out wearing a [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) T-shirt.
* Sędzia Karol Górski reverted back to his Madman Charlie persona during his bout.
* After the main event, Goblin attacked the victorious Olgierd and put a dog collar with a chain on him, in anticipation of the Dog Collar Match between the two at [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md).
