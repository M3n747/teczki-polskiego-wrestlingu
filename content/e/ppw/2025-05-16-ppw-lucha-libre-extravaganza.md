### Recap & notes

* Luchadores spent all of the show ringside, cheering _rudos_ and _tecnicos_ respectively
* Though every performer wore a mask, they were mostly wearing their original ring-gear, allowing to easily recognize their original personas.
* Mister Z was announced under his original name, but wrestled in a mask
* Grabollo was nicknamed "Largest Luchador in Poland". He got unmasked during his match, briefly showing Gryffin's face
* La Gatita vs Czacha saw a series of interferences, from each side and the match devolved into a brawl between rudos and tecnicos, setting up trios main event
* La Gatita scored a win for _Team Tecnicos_ after a crossbody on Hirinus. He kept selling defeat for a long time, even after Michael HT announced the show was over.
* Two of the announced luchadores: Esteban Lucha and Electrico no-showed the event
