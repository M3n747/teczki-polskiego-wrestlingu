Piwa I Igrzysk ("Beer and Games") was an event that took place at Waldorffa 25 on March 11 2023.
Originally, Rafael Kid was scheduled for a match against Aytac Bahar, but was replaced by Adam Wong.
In the main event, Dobroniak came to the ring with both the PpW Ultraviolent Championship belt and the Freedom Pro Wrestling Championship belt that he held at the time. None of the titles were contended for, however.
