TWF: Danger Zone was a show produced by [Toruń Wrestling Federation](@/o/twf.md). It was published on March 31st 2012. 

Original posts published at wrestling forums declares the show's date to be March 24th, but due to fact, that [TWF: Fight For The Freedom!](@/e/twf/2012-03-28-twf-fight-for-freedom.md) was released at March 28th and the following show continues storylines from it, it is probably some kind of error in chronology made by posting TWF member.
