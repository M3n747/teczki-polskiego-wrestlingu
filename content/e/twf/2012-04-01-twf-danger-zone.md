TWF: Danger Zone was a show produced by [Toruń Wrestling Federation](@/o/twf.md). It was published on April 1st 2012. 

Posts on wrestling forums mentions that the show took place during April Fools day, but lack of footage from the show to reviev prevents from deciding if TWF pulled any hoaxes at that show.
