TWF: Danger Zone was a show produced by [Toruń Wrestling Federation](@/o/twf.md). It was published on April 1st, 2012. 

Posts on wrestling forums mention that the show took place on April Fools' Day, but since there is no footage from the show to review, it is unclear whether the event actually happened, or if it was a hoax.
