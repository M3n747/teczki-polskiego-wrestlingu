Gold Rush is an upcoming event by [PTW](@/o/ptw.md). It is being announced as a "Season Finale", which suggests it's going to close some kind of chapter in PTW's history.
The event will feature PTW's cast alongside foreign wrestlers from UK, USA, Germany and Italy, including former WWE performers Justin Gabriel (now as PJ Black), Evan Bourne (Matt Sydal) and NXT UK's Nina Samuels. Heavily promoted is also the involvement of the former Maximum Male Models tag team, consisting of Mason Madden and Mansoor, who as of 2023 are touring the independent wrestling scene. Another name advertised is James Storm, known for his long tenure in TNA/Impact.

Polish celebrity and former boxer Marcin Najman is also expected to appear in some capacity, as the event is held in his hometown.

#### Build-up to the event

* PTW has been teasing the introduction of a singles championship belt for several months. The first champion is going to be crowned in a 20-man royal rumble at this event.
* Dziedzic defeated Disco Pablo and Renegade on PTW Underground 20, with each wrestler's tag team partners present and involved in the match.
