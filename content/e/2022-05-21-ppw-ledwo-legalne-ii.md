Ledwo Legalne II ("Barely Legal 2") was an event that took place on May 21, 2022.
It's notable for being the first PpW event not to be held at the 2Ko≈Ça motorcycle club, and for introducing the [PpW European Ultraviolent Championship](@/o/ppw.md#championships).
The event was held at Waldorffa 25, a dedicated event venue in Bemowo that would later become the main arena for PpW.
