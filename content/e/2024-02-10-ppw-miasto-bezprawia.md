Miasto Bezprawia (_Lawless City_) is an upcoming event by [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md). It will be held in Teatr Komuna, a performing arts venue
that operates in a former school building. This is the first time PpW presents their show in Warsaw's city center.

### Build-up to the event

* Biesiad and Isnorr both intervened in the Johnny Blade vs Chris X match.
* On social media, PpW posted that former MZW and PTW wrestler Gabriel Queen has joined their ranks and is likely to appear in some capacity. This was confirmed with the release of the official poster. Later, another post announced PTW wrestler Samson.
* In a [facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/OficjalnePPW/posts/pfbid02zU3wXTw4DstxtdtphsXJQB3Q7wifMUxgXaYxsAiHfPzxMazGQPtTWYzTCUCfXe3Bl), PpW announced the number of participating wrestlers to beat any of their previous shows.
* Following the success of the joint MZW+PPW event [Å»adnych Granic](@/e/2023-09-23-ppw_mzw-zadnych-granic.md), Shadow will make his first appearance in PPW, in a three-person match that also includes Samson.
* Based on the poster, the show will also feature [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md), [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md), [Ricardo Diesel](@/w/ricardo-diesel.md), [Gustav Gryffin](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md), [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md), [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md), Chris X, [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md), Asara and Gabriel Queen and Samson as noted above
* In a [Facebook video](https://www.facebook.com/OficjalnePPW/videos/263013170024297/), acting boss Mister Z congratulated Gryffin on his show-stealing performance at Turbo OG, and rewarded him with a match against Irish wrestler TJ Charles, with a stipulation of his choosing. In that same video, Goblin, who was Gustav's opponent, is announced to get a match against an unspecified opponent who would be making his debut for PPW.
