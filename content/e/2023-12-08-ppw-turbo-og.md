TURBO OG was a wrestling event organized by [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md), on December 8th 2023, at the [2 Koła](@/v/2kola.md) club.

Because of the low capacity of the venue, the attendance was lower than other events, and tickets sold out extremely fast. The event's name references the previous PpW OG event at the same venue, and refers to the fact that 2koła is the original, first place that held their events.
