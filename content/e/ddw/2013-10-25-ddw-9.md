This event was infamous for very low attendance. This failure to attract fans caused DDW to pause their events until almost a year later, and focus on training. After this event, Jędruś Bułecka and Straceniec would leave DDW to form [MZW](@/o/mzw.md).

#### Summary

* Kaszub and Luxus attacked by Piękny Kawaler even before the fight.
* After their fight, Kawaler continued to beat Robert with a kendo stick. Several wrestlers, including Kamil Leśny intervened. Leśny also gets a brutal kendo stick treatment. Kawaler paints Leśny's face with the same symbols he wears.
* Bianca avoids elimination by hopping on one leg, waiting out successive eliminations at ringside, then low-blows and throws out the prospective winner to claim victory.
* Damian Dunne seeked revenge for his brother Pete [two years earlier](@/e/ddw/2012-03-09-ddw-6.md). After the match, accepted Klarys' handshake and both raised arms together, only for Dunne to deliver a kick to the softies.
* Pacjent knocks out Kamil with a kendo stick, then runs out chasing Pawłowski. Grabbing the opportunity, Aurora pins Kamil for the win.
* [Janusz Wojnarowicz][wojnarowicz], multiple time European judo champion, appears and shakes hands with Jędruś Bułecka who's his favourite wrestler.
* Don Roid with another of his challenges to find the new top guy of DDW. Fight spills out to ringside, Mateusz taps out to Donaconda.
* Afterwards, Don Roid reportedly declared he's done with wrestling in Rzeszów. This would prove true, as after two more shows they relocated to Gdańsk.
