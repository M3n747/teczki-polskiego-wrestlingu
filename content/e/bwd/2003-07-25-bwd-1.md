### Recap

* The show took place outdoors; no mattresses were used, the participants simply wrestled on the ground.
* The audio quality of the video is very poor, often making it difficult to make out.
* The cameraman also doubled as a commentator.
* After the first fight, Kid Crusher approached Obbo with the suggestion of forming a tag team, and going after Vampirro and his title. During the second fight, as Vampirro pinned Kid Crusher, Referee Obbo stopped counting a pin after two, prompting an angry reaction from Vampirro. Obbo and Crusher then turned on the champion.
* In the third match there's a sudden cut, going from Vampirro pinning Kid Crusher to standing over him. Presumably, Crusher kicked out.
* Some dogs can be heard barking during the Handicap Match.
* Obbo attacked Referee Mr. Oko, as Kid Crusher was beating up Vampirro. Seconds later, KAT appeared and rushed to help Vampirro - only to turn around and run away. A short while lated he apparently reconsidered and jumped into the fray after all.
