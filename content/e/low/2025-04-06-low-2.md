The second [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) show, set to take place in the Kr√≥lestwo music club in Katowice.

Two tiers of tickets were made available for this show - regular tickets, and limited VIP tickets (available until mid-March) that also include the show's T-shirt and a poster signed by the wrestlers. At the [previous show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md) T-shirts and posters were available through Patronite, but since only five people decided to pledge, this was likely considered a failure, so the more usual approach of VIP tickets was chosen.

A live Q&A is set to take place the day after the announcement of the show, to answer fans' questions.
