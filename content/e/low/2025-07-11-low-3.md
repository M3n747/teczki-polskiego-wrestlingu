The third [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) show is set to take place in the [Tauron Arena](@/v/tauron-arena.md) in Kraków, on Friday, 11th of July 2025. This will be the first day of Ryucon 2025, a manga-themed convention which for the previous three years hosted shows by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md).

## Build-up

* At [Legacy vol. 2](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md) [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) confronted [Taras](@/w/taras.md) and challanged him to a fight. Taras initially refused, but relented when Pablo gave him the choice of stipulation.
* On 4.06.2025, Legacy published a video where Taras makes his choice. The match between him and Pablo is going to be a _Street fight_, with a returning 3rd member of [PAKA](@/tt/paka.md) - [Boro](@/w/boro.md) as a Special Guest Referee.
