#### Recap

* Nano Lopez appeared with one arm in a sling, addressing his health and potential retirement. Promised to fight Sinister Kingdom after returning from injury.
* This was originally to be the go-home show for [PTW#5 Gold Rush](@/e/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md), however that show was postponed, from December till February next year.
* Before the show closed, Puncher entered the ring and cut a promo about winning the upcoming Rumble match at PTW#5, which resulted in a series of interruptions by:
  * [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md)
  * Wiktor Longman
  * Sędzia Rafał
  * Sinister and Dziedzic (representing Sinister Kingdom)
* After a brief staredown, PAKA (Disco Pablo, [Boro](@/w/boro.md) and Taras) joined, and the situation devolved into a brawl, eventually joined by the rest of the locker room.
* Everyone started throwing their opponents over the top rope, with the "final two" being Wiktor Longman and [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md). Diana stood tall and her music was played.
* The above events are mistakenly listed as [Diana](@/w/diana-strong.md) winning a Battle Royal by some sources, but this was not an actual match, as the bell never rang.
* Pawłowski announced Diana joining the Gold Rush Rumble match line-up.
