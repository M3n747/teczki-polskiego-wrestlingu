Freak Show was the second event held in [Bakara](@/v/bakara.md). It's notable for the debut of Amisz, a fan turned wrestler, who would later adopt the ringname Axel Fox, and Bartosz Borowski, later known as Ladykiller and Boro. The event features new and returning German and Czech wrestlers, and the comeback of Justin Joy, absent since [MZW Beatdown](@/e/2016-05-14-mzw-beatdown.md) more than a year before.
