This was ultimately the last show held under the DDW banner. After moving to Gdańsk, the local team started to run things without the owner's input.
Disappointed by the poor performance of DDW#9, and the need to travel the entire country to run the school and shows now in Gdańsk, Don Roid would soon close down DDW, selling the ring to a new organization which took over the entire roster. That organization would reveal itself later in October that year as [KPW](@/o/kpw.md).
