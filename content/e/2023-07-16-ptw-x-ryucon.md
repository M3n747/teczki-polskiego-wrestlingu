#### Recap

* Syriusz Dziedzic was previously kidnapped and held captive by Sinister. In this return, he became Sinister's ally, with a new look, theme song and a more aggressive moveset.
* In a post-match interview, Sinister answered all questions on behalf of Dziedzic, without allowing him to speak. Sinister announced that the next [Underground show](@/e/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16.md) is when Dziedzic's baptism is going to be held.
* [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md) came alone, without the support of [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md).
* [Karol "Iskra" Górski](@/w/iskra.md) came out to challenge [Diana](@/w/diana-strong.md) to a match on the next Underground show.
* After [Samson](@/w/samson.md)'s match, he was attacked by Sinister and his allies. Marcelito tried to make a save, but got beaten down as well. Lights went out, Nano Lopez entered with a steel chair and successfully makes a save.
* Puncher came out to insult manga fans and culture, and tried burning manga books in a bucket full of gasoline. Some of the gasoline spilled out and burned the ring, a crewmember extinguished the fire.
* Wiktor Longman interrupted Pan Pawłowski. He confirmed cutting ties with John "Bad Bones" Klinger, and proclaimed loyalty to Pawłowski. This storyline saw its conclusion months later at [PTW#5 Gold Rush](@/e/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md).
* The tag team championship defense was a no-contest due to an intervention by Legia Łysych ([Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) & Marco Hammers) with Vic Golden. The champions retained. Both teams chased off the heels. Show ended with babyfaces standing tall.
