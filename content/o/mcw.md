Mine City Wrestling is a small backyard promotion operating in Silesia.

### History
MCW was established in 2011 in Siemianowice Śląskie by Johny Vegas, but unveiled in December 2013, aiming to be an alternative to Polish backyard. The working name of the promotion had been NoN (Now or Never), until Mine City Wrestling was chosen in reference to the coal mining industry of Siemianowice. At a later time the federation moved to Brzeziny and then Tarnowskie Góry, before settling in Świerklaniec.

MCW attempted a crowdfunding campaign in order to rent or purchase a place to hold training sessions in, however only 100 PLN were raised out of the goal of 13,000 PLN. Despite being a very small backyard promotion with limited budget, MCW still has a high-quality professional ring. There's been a rumour that Prime Time Wrestling attempted to buy it from MCW at one point, but Johny Vegas refused to sell. Vegas himself denies such an offer ever happening but agrees he'd refuse anyway if it did.

MCW shows are rare and most of them are intended to raise funds for charities. Despite not having a budget for international stars, MCW nonetheless managed to attract attention of wrestlers from such countries are Ireland or Scotland, who expressed interest in exchanging experiences and appearing in shows.

MCW wrestlers are self-taught, which caused them to be written off multiple times. Despite this, the promotion ran a series of instructional videos on their YouTube channel demonstrating some wrestling moves, both basic and more advanced. Their activity on social media, however, is also infrequent (outside of YouTube shorts, which have been picking up in recent months).

A number of people appeared in the group, although most of them since left, including some who left for Prime Time Wrestling. The best-known names to come out of MCW were Syriusz Dziedzic, Disco Pablo[R4] and Sinister, who wrestled for MCW as David Sirch.
