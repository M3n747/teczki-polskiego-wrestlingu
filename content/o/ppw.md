PpW is a wrestling promotion from Warsaw. It styles itself as a fully independent, self-sufficient organization with no commercial affiliations.
Their wrestling style used to rely heavily on hardcore and deathmatches, but it has since been toned down, and other styles of wrestling are prominently featured. However, no-DQ is assumed for most matches, and its main events are still often hardcore bouts. Only the rare Classic Wrestling Match stipulation prohibits any weapons and interventions.

## Name

There is no canonical meaning of the PpW shortcut, although it may have once stood for Polish Pro Wrestling. The official name is just "PpW Ewenement".
The word "ewenement" means something unique, special and not easily replicated, and could be translated as "phenomenon" or "anomaly".

## History

While its beginnings reach as far back as 2016 or earlier, until about 2020 it was considered a backyard, and not widely recognized. From these early years, not many people still remain active. In 2020, PpW started to cooperate with the Polish and European wrestling scenes, inviting wrestlers to their events, and participating in training and other events by promotions in Sweden and Austria. 2022 saw them cooperate with MZW in a joint event during a craft beer festival in Poznań, with a reprise the following year. In 2023, PpW was recognized by Cagematch, and some of its events and wrestlers have been added to their database. WrestleMap features news about PpW since 2021.

Uniquely for the Polish wrestling scene, PpW shares no ancestry with other promotions, all of which can be traced back to DDW.

In 2023, due to tensions in [PTW](@/o/ptw.md), a number of its wrestlers appeared on PpW shows, quitting their promotion openly and criticizing its owner on social media. This further boosted PpW's image on the Polish scene, as a place dedicated to the joy of wrestling, and not commercial endeavors.

### Lost Lore

PpW used to have a Wikia page with detailed internal lore and history, including storied feuds, rankings, character backgrounds, past events and videos from the backyard era. This went defunct in 2023, and was unavailable, even on Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. Snippets could be found in cached results on Google when searching for certain related terms, but most of it was lost.

That wiki was located at `ppwofficial.fandom.com` (and `ppwofficial.wikia.com` earlier before the renaming).

#### Restored!

In March 2024 it has been restored from a backup, in a text-only form, and can be found at [ppw-fandom.tpwres.pl](https://ppw-fandom.tpwres.pl/). It's preserved as-is, with no editing capability, using a basic Wikipedia-like template. While a part of Teczki, since both share a domain, it's treated as an archived publication, made available on the Internet once again.

## Botchamania

PpW made Botchamania twice.

During a match on [Ledwo Legalne II](@/e/ppw/2022-05-21-ppw-ledwo-legalne-ii.md) on May 21, 2022, [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) set [Osamu](@/w/osamu.md) on a table in the middle of the ring, and climbed on support beams outside the ring to perform a jump onto the opponent. He connected very lightly, landing on his legs instead, and the table failed to break, although one set of legs did collapse. This was featured in [Botchamania 455](https://youtu.be/eurthT-CbUg?t=485), at the 8:05 mark.
