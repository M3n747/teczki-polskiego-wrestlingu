WKSW was a backyard group active between 2010 and 2014, from a town named Wołów, located about 50km northwest of Wrocław.
Starting out as WFW (Wołowska Federacja Wrestlingu), the group was formed by three friends fascinated by wrestling, staging fights on mattresses, initially without any training.
As the group grew, drawing in other teenagers fascinated by wrestling, they were able to pool their resources to book time in a sports hall to train and stage their shows.
Later, after fulfilling some legal requirements, the group registered as a sports club, prompting the name change.

The group attracted media attention in the area: newspaper publication Angora printed a short column in 2011, and according to their crowdfunding page (more on that below), regional broadcaster TVP Wrocław took interest, as well as the commercial Polsat (flagship news show Wydarzenia on 2014-03-22) and TVN networks.

The group folded at some point in 2014, and later deleted all their videos uploaded to YouTube.

A crowdfunding campaign in 2017 tried to reboot WKSW, and buy a professional wrestling ring.
Confusingly, the campaign description has a photo of a wrestling ring in their regular venue, a sports hall located at Panieńska street in Wołów, and mentions that the media visited them both "before and after the ring".
The campaign offered rewards like a one-time GM position, wrestling merch, advertising opportunities.
It was unsuccessful, not even raising 1% of the stated goal of 30,000 PLN.
