Toruń Wrestling Federation was a backyard wrestling organisation from Toruń, active from 2011 to 2014.

## History

TWF begginings can be traced back to May 2011, when the first concept for a backyard federation was published on Polish wrestling forums. In August 2011 federation announced that they held their first face-to-face meeting. The roster allegedly consisted of eight workers for start. They held their first show, which was published online, at September 22nd the same year. From that point on TWF published a series of shows. Teir upload schedule was rather irregular, but they managed to be a active federation throughout the years. Their activity intensified especially during holidays, summer and winter break, when roster had the most spare time. It was also a place, where many of [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md) fo)nders started their career. Among them were [Corin Mear](@/w/corin-mear.md), [PJ Blake](@/w/pj-blake.md), [Chris Hunter](@/w/chris-hunter.md) and Jay Revolt.

Eventually, after about three years of activity TWF folded its operations in 2014. Huge part of the roster went to start Dream Factory Wrestling.

## Polish wrestling scene

Some of TWF wrestlers managed to make their appearances for other Polish backyards. The highlight of these appearances was a spot at [Backyardmania III](@/e/pxw/2012-07-24-pxw-backyardmania-3.md) which was held by Głuchołazy-based promotion [Polish Xtreme Wrestling](@/o/pxw.md).

## Championships

Toruń Wrestling Federation promoted three championships in their history. The first one was TWF Championship, and the second one was promoted as Toruń Championship. Third one - Wrzosy Championship (named after one of Toruń's districts) - appeared as active on TWF website from July to August 2012, but in September it was seemingly retired or unified with another Championship.
