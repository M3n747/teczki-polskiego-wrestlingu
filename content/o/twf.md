Toruń Wrestling Federation was a backyard wrestling organisation from Toruń, active between 2011 and 2014.

## History

TWF's beginnings can be traced back to May 2011, when the first concept for a new backyard federation was published on Polish wrestling forums. In August 2011 the federation announced that they'd held their first face-to-face meeting. The initial roster allegedly consisted of eight workers. They held their first show, which was published online, on September 22nd the same year. From that point on TWF published a series of shows. Their upload schedule was rather irregular, but they managed to remain active over the years. Their activity intensified especially during holidays, and summer/winter breaks, when the roster had the most free time. TWF was also a place where many of [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md) founders started their careers. Among them were [Corin Mear](@/w/corin-mear.md), [PJ Blake](@/w/pj-blake.md), [Chris Hunter](@/w/chris-hunter.md) and Jay Revolt.

Eventually, after about three years of activity, TWF folded its operations in 2014. A huge part of the roster went on to start Dream Factory Wrestling.

## Polish wrestling scene

Some of TWF wrestlers worked with other Polish backyards. The highlight of these appearances was a spot at [Backyardmania III](@/e/pxw/2012-07-24-pxw-backyardmania-3.md), which was held by Głuchołazy-based promotion [Polish Xtreme Wrestling](@/o/pxw.md).

## Championships

Toruń Wrestling Federation promoted three Championships in their history. The first one was TWF Championship, and the second belt was promoted as Toruń Championship. The third title - Wrzosy Championship, named after one of Toruń's districts - appeared as active on TWF website from July to August 2012, but in September it was seemingly retired or unified with another Championship.
