Supron Stars was a first existing professional wrestling federation in Poland, active in early 1990s. 

## History

After learning about professional wrestling from TV during his visit in United States [Andrzej Supron](@/w/andrzej-supron.md) - Polish greco-roman wrestler - decided to contact Ivan Putski - Poland's born professional wrestler - to learn more about the business. Supron decided to bring pro wrestling to Poland, where at that time it was an unknown form of entertaiment. He recruited some of bodybuilders, sportsmen and actors (such as Władysław Komar and Edyta Górniak) to train them loosely on his own, before starting a touring federation. They hosted a couple of shows in Poland, but also in ex-soviet republics such as Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Armenia, Azerbajian etc. According to few avaliable sources these shows were met with good amount of sucess, especially abroad. The group was active sometime from aroun 1990 until 1992 when group disbanded, and Andrzej Supron went to invite foregin - more professional - talent to host [World Wrestling Superstars](@/o/wws.md) show in Poland. Despite very little info avaliable, Supron Stars is considered to be first Polish wrestling organisation in history.
