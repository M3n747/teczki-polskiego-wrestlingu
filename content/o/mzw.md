MZW is a wrestling promotion estabilished in 2014, which currently makes it the oldest still active promotion in Poland.
Its specialty is aerial acrobatics, especially as performed by Justin Joy or Shadow, and international cooperation, especially with German organizations. MZW operates on a shoestring budget, and has no regular or titular sponsors. Despite that, wrestlers who trained with them are highly regarded for their wrestling skills, and some have continued their career outside Poland.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic of 2019-2021, MZW's activity has decreased significantly, with no events held in 2022 at all. In 2021 they produced a series of events without live audience (Project Basement), which were released online.

## Locations

Since 2018, MZW held most of their events in Wrocław, either in Bakara or Czasoprzestrzeń, with the latter becoming their main venue.
Before that, it was Głuchołazy, a town near the Polish-Czech border where many of their events took place, and where they trained new adepts. And prior to that, events were held in various small towns in the region, like Opawa, Smolec and Niedźwiedzica.
