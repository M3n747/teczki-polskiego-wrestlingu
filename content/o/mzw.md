MZW is a wrestling promotion estabilished in 2014, which currently makes it the oldest still active promotion in Poland.
It is known for frequent international cooperation, especially with German organizations. MZW has no regular or titular sponsors, and considers itself an independent European promotion. Wrestlers who trained with them are highly regarded for their skills, and some have continued their career outside Poland.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic of 2019-2021, MZW's activity has decreased significantly, with no events held in 2022 at all. In 2021 they produced a series of events without live audience (Project Basement), which were released on YouTube.

## Locations

Since 2018, MZW held most of their events in Wrocław, either in [Bakara](@/v/bakara.md) or [Czasoprzestrzeń](@/v/czasoprzestrzen.md), with the latter becoming their main venue.
Before that, it was the [sports hall in Głuchołazy](@/v/gosir-glucholazy.md), a town near the Polish-Czech border where many of their events took place, and where they trained new adepts. And prior to that, events were held in various small towns in the region, like Opawa, Smolec and Niedźwiedzica.

## History

Maniac Zone Wrestling started quietly in 2013, created by then DDW wrestlers Jędruś Bułecka and Straceniec.
After [DDW#9](@/e/2013-10-25-ddw-9.md), there was a significant hiatus when they held no events.
On April 1st 2014, Jędruś Bułecka's Facebook profile posted that he has signed up with a new Polish wrestling federation.
His post linked to a newly created fanpage for MZW, and a short video of their wrestlers and adepts in action.
The new organization promised regular monthly shows, bigger events including foreign stars, and training sessions.

Initially, the roster featured Jędruś Bułecka, Shadow (a new, masked gimmick of the former Straceniec), and several ex-backyard wrestlers trained by Bułecka.
Many of these characters were masked, leading to fans calling the new organisation "Polish lucha".
The promotion prepared its debut carefully, registering with all required authorities, purchasing a proper ring and recruiting a video production crew.
Because their first two events were sideshows on other attractions like various town festivals, fans derided the new organisation for being just a sideshow and not aiming for professionalism. However, there was consensus that their wrestling was of very high quality, exceeding that of their contemporaries.

MZW was most active from 2014 to 2019, holding about five events a year. In 2020, several wrestlers would quit and join the newly created [PTW](@/o/ptw.md), to become part of its first roster. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, PTW's start was delayed till 2021.
