## History

The title was first mentioned at [PTW #5](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) and officially announced by PTW's owner and General Manager, [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), in a December 2024 interview for the [MyWrestling YouTube channel][pawłowski-my-wrestling-live]. Pawłowski stated that a tournament would be held over the course of several shows, to crown the inaugural champion. 

The tournament actually started at [PTW: Nowe Porządki](@/e/ptw/2025-01-11-ptw-nowe-porzadki.md) and continued at the pace of one match per show. There was little transparency and no bracket was never presented, requiring some assumptions to be made. Following the first round matches, there are four contenders left: [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md), Betty Boa, Heidi Katrina and Lucia Lee. It is likely that the next round will be semi-finals, consisting of two matches between any chosen combination between these four.

Although there were no tournament matches since [PTW: Prezes vs Prezes](@/e/ptw/2025-04-12-ptw-prezes-vs-prezes.md), PTW keeps bringing the tournament up in their programming, reiterating it is still on.

## Belt design

The belt design has not yet been revealed as of 9.07.2025.
