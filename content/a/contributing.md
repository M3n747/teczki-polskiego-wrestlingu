TPW would not exist if not for the wealth of mostly unorganized information out there. That's why it needs collaborators! You are welcome to contribute your knowledge, correct mistakes, and supply new sources and references.

TPW is not a wiki however, though. While anyone can contribute, there's a process to it. You should have basic knowledge of using GitHub, and the fork and pull-request based workflow.
Github has an useful [introduction][github-hello-world], and there are many other resources online.

If you don't want, or cannot do that, you can also open issues in the issue tracker, flagging problems or supplying extra information to a page. This still requires a GitHub account, but nothing more than an internet browser to do.
