This is the second edition of the PTW End-of-the-Year Awards.

PTW Awards 2024 were a follow-up to the [2022 edition](@/a/ptw-awards-2022.md), as the 2023 one didn't take place. 

Like previously, the winners were to be decided by fans on the official PTW Facebook fanpage by voting with FB reactions for the nominees. The voting started in mid-December 2024 and was set to comprise ten categories.

On 30.12.2024 fans noticed a sudden influx of votes for Spartan in the "Wrestler of the Year" and "Hero of the Year" categories. Just like in 2022, those votes came from Vietnamese accounts.

Although initially presented as a genuine fan-voted popularity contest, the 2024 PTW Awards turned out to be a worked angle. At [Nowe Porządki](@/e/ptw/2025-01-11-ptw-nowe-porzadki.md) [Alex Brave](@/w/alex-brave.md) cut a promo on [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md] accusing him of buying votes, whereas [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) gave the award to [Vincent Caravaggio](@/w/vincent-caravaggio.md), despite [Miyagi Shida](@/w/miyagi-shida.md) having the majority. PTW then seemingly dropped the angle, as the Awards were not mentioned again.
