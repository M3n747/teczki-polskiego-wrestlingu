"Zmowa" (_The Collusion_), is a villainous professional wrestling stable that performs mainly in [PpW](@/o/ppw.md), while making sporadic apperances in other polish promotions such as [MZW](@/o/mzw.md). The group's name came from [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md), who started using such name during his feud with [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) - PpW's booker and promotor - and his allies.

## History

Beggining of "Zmowa" dates back to late 2023 / early 2024, when the villainous PpW's producer Mister Z formed an alliance with Gustav Gryffin and Jakub Linde - Gustav's enforcer. Later on the group was cooperating with Rafi. Legia Łysych joined "Zmowa" shortly after their debut at [PpW Ledwo Legalne IV](@/e/ppw/2024-06-08-ppw-ledwo-legalne-4.md) where they defeated Pure Gold. In mid-2024 Isnorr joined "Zmowa" as their (_Ultraviolent Specialist_).
It became clear, that "Zmowa" aims for total domination in every division of PpW, working together to achieve their goals by supporting each other in matches against their opponents. They become enemies with almost all of the rest of PpW's roster, including: [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md), [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md), [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md), Pure Gold ([Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) & [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md)), [Samson](@/w/samson.md) and [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md).
After intense confrontation at [PpW Hardcore Friday 2](@/e/ppw/2024-09-20-ppw-hardcore-friday-2.md) Biesiad announced a formation of impromptu alliance of babyfaces called "Zmowa Przeciwko Zmowie" (_The Collusion Against The Collusion_) and challenged "Zmowa" for a tag team match at [PpW Co Za Noc](@/e/ppw/2024-10-26-ppw-co-za-noc.md).
