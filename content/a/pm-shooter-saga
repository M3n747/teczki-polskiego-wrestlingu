In the end of 2024, [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) introduced a sponsorship deal with Warsaw shooting range, PM Shooter. Contrary to usual deals, the brand quickly got involved in storylines, with shooting range crew presented as band of mercenaries, aiming to end [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) on [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md)'s behest.

## History
### Initial stages (December 2024-March 2025)

On 19th December 2024, [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) announced their partnership with PM Shooter, a Warsaw shooting range. They teased some further surprises, which turned out to be a special discount for the range, earned by showing PpW ticket.

Beginning with [Gruba Przesada](@/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md), PpW started to incorporate PM Shooter logo into event posters and branding

### Incorporation into storylines

On March 4th, PpW uploaded a video, where Mister Z incapacitates [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) in Blade's shoot workplace and PpW arena - [2koła](@/v/2kola.md). Blade is seen hanging with his legs tied to the ceiling, when Biesiad barges in and saves him. Blade reports that Z went shooting - with Biesiad quickly recognizing he went to PM Shooter shooting range and starting the chase.
On March 5th, PpW uploaded a video of Biesiad and Mister Z being involved in a shootout at PM Shooter's shooting range. First, Mister Z trains shooting on cardboards with Biesiad silhouette glued on them. Biesiad appears in a leather jacket and wearing ammunition tapes (a look resembling, starts to shoot directly at Z. After the exchange of shots, Biesiad gets the upperhand and Mister Z runs away in a pickup truck. Frustrated Biesiad breaks the gun he was using, the camera pans to the venue with large PM Shooter neon.
Those events, though seemingly a promotional stunt, were quickly recognized as canon by PpW and resulted in the announcement of Johnny Blade vs Mister Z for [Teraz Albo Nigdy](@/e/ppw/2025-03-15-ppw-teraz-albo-nigdy.md) as a punishment for Biesiad's "attempted murder" on Z.

### Arrest angle

At Teraz Albo Nigdy, Mister Z revealed that the court granted him a restraining order and now Biesiad is not allowed to come into his proximity.
After Biesiad got eliminated from _20 chłopa 20 broni Rumble Match_, he continued to brawl with Mister Z a band of uniformed henchmen carrying long fireamrs and wearing PM shooter colors, captured Biesiad and escorted outside the arena. It was later revealed that at future show, [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md), Biesiad would face a "serviceman" to regain his freedom.
[Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) provided a follow up to the angle, announcing Biesiad for a 5-way match at [LoW vol.2](content/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md), with a caveat that Biesiad might not make it due to the arrest.
The storyline continued with Biesiad's Instagram account kayfabe taken by PM Shooter and all the posts and stories written from their point of view. Via insta-stories, they announced that Biesiad is granted a leave for Legacy show.
Biesiad made his entrance handcuffed, with his legs chained and escorted to the ring by two members of the PM Shooter team, continuing the storyline. Towards the end of the match, Biesiad briefly exited the ring, only to be brutally captured by the PM Shooter team again, who handcuffed and escorted him outside the venue. It seems like his leave from PM Shooter's confinement was only temporary.
On 13.04 PpW posted the video of Biesiad held in custody and tortured by PM Shooter mercenaries.
On 14.04 PpW posted the video of Jonny Blade infiltrating the PM Shooter complex. He frees Biesiad and they try to run away. Just when they are about to jump the fence, Blade gets shot. Biesiad is taken back into custody, while the mercenaries dig a grave to bury the wounded Blade.
After this, Biesiad's phone was found by Red Floorfiller, who continued to post the content via Insta-stories - a callback to PpW's backyard lore.
On 22.04.2025 PpW posted yet another video in the PM Shooter saga. In this one, Mister Z can be seen honoring his deal with the PM Shooter mercenaries. He pays them in Peruvian artifacts and offers additional bounty in the form of the talisman of King Cápac if they finish Biesiad once and for all. This would mean humiliating him in the ring by sending the strongest mercenary to beat him. Mr Z would become the special referee.

### Fight for freedom

On 23.04.2025 PpW announced that at [Ostatnia Prosta](@/e/ppw/2025-04-30-ppw-ostatnia-prosta.md) Biesiad Strong would face Scandinavian wrestler Mr Power Up (PM Shooter's kayfabe hired gun), and that the match would be officiated by Mister Z as the Special Guest Referee.
Biesiad made his entrance for the match, once again chained and escorted by PM shooter crew. With both competitors getting hyped up for the upcoming fight, big screen showed the recap of Biesiad's escape attempt and Mister Z's deals. PM shooter crew remained at ringside. Mister Z as referee played favorites for Mr Power Up, ignoring obvious breaking of the rules. Against all odds, Biesiad won the match, despite Mister Z's best efforts to count slowly.
Post-match, one of PM Shooter members, seemingly the leader, voices his frustration at Power Up's performance and demands compensation for the job. Mister Z said that due to the job's failure, the deal is off and they will get no amulet. PM shooter leader reminds Z that they will get their compensation one way or the other. They surrounded the ring and attacked Mister Z, while Biesiad suddenly made the save. The two bitter opponents fight side by side just for a minute and crowd chants "Power of friendship". Coming from each side of the ring, they suddenly bump their backs and realize what just happened. They quickly break contact and face off. Biesiad grabbed the mic and made an ultimatum for Z - either he gives Biesiad a match at [Ledwo Legalne 5](content/e/ppw/2025-06-07-ppw-ledwo-legalne-5.md) or he gets beaten up right at this moment. Mister Z begrudgingly accepts and gives Biesiad the choice of stipulation, immediately announced as "Cieśla Match".

### Johnny's fate

After the show, when Michael HT started to close the show, the lights suddenly went out. The big screen shown a video package of some necromantic rituals, resulting in Johnny Blade rising from the grave. The lights went back on and Johnny Blade was seen standing in the ring, looking like a zombie. He picked up the mic and called out [Stanisław van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md), supposedly challenging him for a match.
