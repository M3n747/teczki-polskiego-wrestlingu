## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2023-2024)

Karyna made her debut in [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) at [Underground 14](@/e/ptw/2023-04-23-ptw-underground-14.md) where she was portraying a character of [Olgierd's](@/w/olgierd.md) girlfriend and valet. Her gimmick, and also a characteristic ringname, was heavily inspired by stereotypical Polish Chav Girl. In total she made seven apperances as valet for Legia Łysych - a villainous Tag Team of Olgierd and [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md). Her last public apperance took place at [PTW #5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) where Legia Łysych gave her an ultimatum - either she shaves her head bald, or she is out of the team - she did not anwsered Olgierd's call, which resulted in her being dumped by bald tag team. Later on she arrived during Gold Rush Rumble Match, where she walked towards eliminated Olgierd and slapped him, thus officially ending their on-screen relationship. After that apperance she seemingly retired from wrestling.
