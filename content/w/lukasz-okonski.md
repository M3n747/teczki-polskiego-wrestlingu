## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2024-present)

#### Debut

Starting with [Underground 21](@/w/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21.md), PTW moved from Chorzów to Kozłów and settled in a local [hotel/restaurant](@/v/dworek-kozlow.md) owned by Łukasz Okoński. He became increasingly invovled in the product, first appearing in promo segments, then becoming PTW's co-owner and later the same year making his in-ring debut against Serg Sullivan. His appearance sparked some controversy, as he wore a BDSM-style mask and was led into the ring on a chain held by a scantly-clad woman, which seemd contrary to the promotion's intended family-friendly image.
