Psychodela was a masked luchador from [PpW](@/o/ppw.md). According to [Michael HT](@/w/michael-ht.md) he was not any single wreslter, but rather a persona inhabited by multiple people. One of them was Tymon, who was active during PpW's backyard days and ended his career before the promotion went pro.
