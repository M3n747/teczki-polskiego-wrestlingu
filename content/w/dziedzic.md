## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

#### Debut and "The Future of Polish Wrestling"

Dziedzic made his debut at [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) at their first show [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md), where he teamed up with Marius Al-Ani to defeat [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) and former WWE superstar [Santino](@/w/santino.md). They managed to win a match, but after that cocky personality of Dziedzic caused him to be left out and punished by Santino and PAKA in front of the audience. He adapted a villainous persona of "The Future of Polish Wrestling". He got involved in a feud with PAKA, where he alligned himself with other heels such as [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) and [Puncher](@/w/puncher.md). This led them to a Six-Man Tag Team Match at [BlackOut](@/e/ptw/2022-02-19-ptw-2-blackout.md) in which Dziedzic Team was defeated by the babyfaces. 

#### Losing streak 

Following his defeat at BlackOut Dziedzic went into a long losing streak which lasted for over a year and a half. During that time he tried numerous things to gain any advantage which will allow him to win a match. During his feud with [Samson](@/w/samson.md) he hired [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) as his mercenary to attack and injure his opponent during contract signing for their match at [Legends](@/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends.md). Despite succesfully pulling Samson out of the card, Dziedzic was punished by [Spartan](@/w/spartan.md), who attacked cocky Dziedzic during the show. After Dziedzic and Longman lost their First Round Tag Team Match for the inaugural [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) Tournament Wiktor finally turned on his "client", leaving him alone. 

#### Sinister Kingdom

Numerous failures led Dziedzic into adapting more dark and desperate persona. At [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) he joined Sinister Kingdom - a villainous stable of Sinister and [Krampus](@/w/krampus.md). Joining Sinister Kingdom allowed Dziedzic to enough momentum to finally break his losing streak by defeating [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) at [RyuCon 2](@/e/ptw/2023-07-16-ptw-x-ryucon.md). At [Underground 16](@/e/ptw/2023-07-30-ptw-underground-16.md) got officially "baptised" in Sinister Kingdom ranks. Leadership of Sinister allowed him to get onto a winning streak and eventually join a Fatal Four Way Tag Team Match at [Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) where he - along with Sinister -faced PAKA, Budapest Bastards and MxM Collection. They were unsucessful in securing a win, but they stood tall, as according to Sinister they only cared about PAKA losing Tag Team titles.

#### Total Blast and departure

At [Total Blast From The Past](@/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6.md), Dziedzic and Krampus were involved in a surprise attack on Babathunder and Puncher in the main event of the show. Dziedzic an Krampus laid out both competitors, causing a no-contest ending. Standing tall alongside Krampus over the beaten-up Puncher and Babathunder, Dziedzic exclaimed "For his is the power, the kingdom and the glory, for ever" (Sinister's catchphrase, albeit slightly out of order), presumably challenging for the title on Sinister's behalf. The main event's finish was widely criticised by fans and never amounted to any storyline developments.

On May 31st 2024, Dziedzic appeared on the first episode of "No Gimmick Zone", a new YouTube show by Błażej "Blaze" Pniewski. Blaze, who had been a vocal supporter of PTW up to this point, expressed his disappointment with the Total Blast show, and slowly but surely turned against the project. Dziedzic openly appeared under his real name (Kacper Dziedzic), in a shoot-style interview. He discussed various backstage topics, from the creation of gimmicks to issues in PTW and the wider Polish scene. He supported the vision of Polish wrestling without boundaries, a phrase which PTW owner [Arkadiusz "Pan" Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) coined but never truly committed to. This concept is about inter-promotional cooperation on the Polish scene. Dziedzic alleged that, even if Pawłowski disliked his remarks, he will stay loyal to PTW as that's where his heart is. He stated that he's going to attend PTW training on the upcoming Sunday, and face possible consequences. 

Three days later, on June 3rd, Dziedzic confirmed, that he has been officially fired from Prime Time Wrestling, thus ending his time in the company.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2024-)

Four months after his release from PTW Dziedzic made his first in-ring appearance for [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) at their show [No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md). He worked as a babyface and took part in a Triple Threat Match against [Biesiad](@/w/biesiad.md) and [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md) which he won, as well as in a Battle Royal later in the card, which was won by [Tony "The Riverman" Sheen](@/w/riverman.md). 

At MZW's [next show](@/e/mzw/2025-03-29-mzw-forever.md) Dziedzic answered Legia Łysych open challenge, with [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) as his tag team partner, however, they were unable to secure a victory over experienced Tag Team. 

### Legacy of Wrestling (2024-)

#### Feud with Sinister

Dziedzic joined [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md), a Katowice-based project funded by ex-PTW personalities shortly after LoW's creation. At [Legacy's first show](@/e/low/2024-12-01-low-1.md) guest host [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md) added Dziedzic as a extra contender in [Chemik's](@/w/chemik.md) Triple Threat Match for [KPW OldTown Championship](@/c/kpw-old-town-championship.md). During the match Sinister unexpectedly prevented Dziedzic from breaking Chemik's pinfall attempt, which caused him to got into conflict with his old master. At the [next show](@/e/low/2025-04-06-low-2.md) Dziedzic faced Sinister in a Singles Match which determined contendership for soon-to-be LoW Championship. Sinister refused to fight Dziedzic and vowed that Dziedzic will win that match no matter what. Old mentor of Syriusz tanked the whole match first by avoiding the fight, then by allowing Dziedzic to beat him without any defence, just to perform a "Judas kiss" and hit Dziedzic in the groin to cause a Disqualification and allow Dziedzic to win.
