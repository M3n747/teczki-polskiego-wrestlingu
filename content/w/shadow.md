## Professional wrestling career

### 2011-2012 Polish Xtreme Wrestling
Shadow started out as a backyard wrestler for [Polish Xtreme Wrestling](@/o/pxw.md) in his hometown Głuchołazy where he performed as Terry Shadow, showcasing his high-risk, high-flying style. During his time in this backyard promotion he managed to win their ECW Championship at least once.

### 2013 Do Or Die Wrestling

2013 was the year, when Terry Shadow left PXW to start professional training with [Do or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) in Rzeszów, joining their roster as Straceniec (_The Condemned_). However, he only had two fights: at [DDW #8](@/e/ddw/2013-08-17-ddw-8.md) and [DDW #9](@/e/ddw/2013-10-25-ddw-9.md).
Dissatisfied with [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md)'s way of running the promotion, he left along with [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) in order to start a new federation.

### 2013-present Maniac Zone Wrestling 

#### Głuchołazy Era
Shadow started Maniac Zone Wrestling along with Jędruś Bułecka in Głuchołazy. From the very start of federation he was considered one of the most influencial figures in MZW as one of their top babyfaces, despite his mysterious and ambigous gimmick. 
In 2016 he briefly feuded with [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md) for [MZW Championship](@/c/mzw-championship.md). He won it in a Loser Leaves Town Match at [MZW Beatdown](@/e/mzw/2016-05-14-mzw-beatdown.md). He held it for 385 days until he has been defeated by [Asmund](@/w/asmund.md) in a hardcore match at [MZW Champions War III](@/e/mzw/2017-06-03-mzw-champions-war-3.md). He regained it over 225 days later at [MZW Big Rumble](@/e/mzw/2018-01-14-mzw-big-rumble.md) - the last show held in Głuchołazy.
During that time he continued his training abroad, attending classes mostly in Germany. From now on he also started making regular apperances at germany-located federations such as Next Step Wrestling, and later also Eastside Revolution Wrestling.

#### Moving to Wrocław; "Project" Era & gaining control 

After MZW's moving to Wrocław Jędruś Bułecka began to slowly withdraw from MZW operations due to personal reasons. From mid-2018 to mid-2019 Maniac Zone Wrestling was _de facto_ runned by Shadow, Justin Joy and Asmund. During that time MZW was hosting shows regurally.
Shadow's second reign as MZW Champion ended when he was defeated by [Damien Rotschild](@/e/mzw/2019-02-09-mzw-project-3-black-white.md).

After [PAW's](@/o/paw.md) summercamp 2019 and [MZW Project 6: Death & Glory](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md) Asmund and Justin left their positions as members of MZW's board, leaving Shadow as sole owner of MZW and PAW. 

Due to COVID restrictions MZW was forced to cease their operations for longer time. However, during that time Shadow decided to produce taped events held in [Ostrowskiego Venue](@/v/ostrowskiego-wroclaw.md) called [MZW Project Basement](@/e/mzw/2021-03-18-mzw-project-basement-1.md). He also dealt with "Green Revolution" - a huge talent loss of talent due to personal and managerial conflicts with members of ["Greens"](@/a/the-greens.md).

After COVID Shadow continued to run Maniac Zone Wrestling events as promoter and one of in-ring workers - rather with irregular schedule. He also continued to run PAW as head coach, along with moving its operations to Kępno.

In addition to performing in Poland, Shadow has also wrestled for a number of international promotions, particularly for Germany-based Eastside Revolution Wrestling.

### 2023-2024 PpW & Legacy of Wrestling

In late 2023 Shadow made history by co-organising joint show [MZW+PpW: Żadnych Granic](@/e/ppw/2023-09-23-ppw_mzw-zadnych-granic.md) thus finally acknowledging [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) as professional federation on polish wrestling scene. He later cemented that by making his PpW debut couple of months later at [PpW Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md).
He was also announced as one of the stars of newly-founded federation called [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md), as he was scheduled to face [Marcelito](@/w/marcelito.md)
