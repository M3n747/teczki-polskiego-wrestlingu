## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2014-2015)

Beginning as a trainee in [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md), he wrestled in two shows under the ringname "Rex Torpeda" before switching his role to that of a referee.

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2015-present)

After DDW folded and [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) took its place, Malinowski continued refereeing for the new promotion, along with [Karol Górski](@/w/iskra.md) and, from time to time, also Artur Dzwończak.

#### Chairman of KPW

Ahead of [Arena 12](@/e/kpw/2019-01-19-kpw-arena-12.md), KPW announced that a new Chairman would be elected, and Malinowski threw his name in the hat as a candidate, alongside [Krzysztof Zasada](@/w/krzysztof-zasada.md) and [Piękny Kawaler](@/w/piekny-kawaler.md).
Eventually he secured the new position at [Arena 13](@/e/kpw/2019-04-05-kpw-arena-13.md) and his previous duties as a referee were taken over by Dariusz Łępicki.

At [Arena 26: Wyścig](@/e/kpw/2024-11-15-kpw-arena-26.md) Malinowski was attacked with a glass bottle by a mysterious figure and transported to a hospital by medical staff. Rosetti soon informed that  Malinowski had officially made him the acting chairman of KPW. Barely [two shows later](@/e/kpw/2025-04-11-kpw-arena-28.md) Malinowski reappeared and took back his position, but the turn of events pushed him into a heel turn, which he fully embraced starting with [Arena 29](@/e/kpw/2025-06-20-kpw-arena-29.md).
