## Professional wrestling career

### PpW Ewenement (2022-2024)

Jerry "Rich" Mandecky is PpW's former (kayfabe) owner and authority figure. He is an American-born businessman who earned his first million USD at the age of 20 due to his extreme talent for investing. As a lifelong wrestling fan, he decided to use his wealth to support growing hardcore wrestling in Poland.

In May 2022 PpW posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyz8750GJ-o&ab_channel=PpWEwenementWrestling) where Mandecky and his associate coerced a masked figure (presumably Rob Scaffold) to sign off PpW ownership to them. Mandecky proudly announced that his "Mandecky Investment Group" has acquired PpW. He explained his business background, prior contributions to PpW and announced a new venue for PpW - [Waldorffa 25](@/v/waldorffa25.md)
At [PpW Ewenement Haze](@/e/ppw/2024-04-20-ppw-ewenement-haze.md) he was betrayed and disposed of by his former bodyguard, [Kapitan Bazooka](@/w/kapitan-bazooka.md). At the same show it was announced that he is now considered missing. PpW's "Executive Producer" [Mister Z](@/w/mister-z.md) revealed that contract between him and Mandecky named Z the legal successor of Mandecky, thus giving "Executive Producer" full authority over PpW.
