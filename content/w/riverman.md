## Professional wrestling career

### Various backyard promotions

Over the span of 2010s, Sheen competed for various Polish backyard promotions, including [PXW](@/o/pxw.md), WSW and [WKSW](@/o/wksw.md). Per his account, he main-evented the final WKSW show.

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2023-)

Sheen, not announced by name, refereed two MZW shows in 2023.
In 2024, he made his in-ring debut for the promotion at [MZW No Time To Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md) as Tony "The Riverman" Sheen, winning a battle royal. Wearing raincoat and using fishing net as his signature weapon, Sheen's character seems to take sailor culture as an inspiration.
At the next MZW show, Sheen faced [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md), winning thanks to distraction from [Taras](@/w/taras.md)
