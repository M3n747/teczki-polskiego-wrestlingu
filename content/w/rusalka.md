Rusałka is [Sambor's](@/w/sambor.md) valet, often accompanying him at ringside. In keeping with his Slavic theme, she is named after a [creature from Slavic folklore][rusalka]. The two seem to share a sort of mystical connection: Rusałka would often mimic Sambor's moves and also appear to suffer when Sambor is hit, and at one point during [MZW No Time to Die](@/e/mzw/2024-10-12-mzw-no-time-to-die.md) she even began to bleed at the same time as the Slavic warrior.
