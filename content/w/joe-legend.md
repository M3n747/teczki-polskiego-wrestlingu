## Professional wrestling career

### Do Or Die Wrestling (2009-2012)

Joe Legend made his debut in Poland at [Do Or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) in July 2009, when he worked at [DDW's first Open House Show](@/e/ddw/2009-07-20-ddw-open-house.md) in Warsaw. He took on and defeated DDW's owner and head coach [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md) in a Singles Match, which was the only one match of the night. Later on Legend returned in May 2010 to score a victory in a Ten Man Gauntlet Match for [DDW International Championship](@/c/ddw-international-championship.md) at [DDW All Or Nothing](@/e/ddw/2010-05-08-ddw-all-or-nothing.md). He emerged victorious from this bout, which made him the first champion in modern Polish professional wrestling history. In 2011 and 2012 he made three more apperances for DDW defending his championship twice. The last one took place at [DDW #7](@/e/ddw/2012-03-10-ddw-7.md) in March 2012. In a main event of said show he fought on against [Kamil Aleksander](@/w/kamil-aleksander.md), with a match being ruled as No-Contest.
