## Professional wrestling career

### Dream Factory Wrestling (2016-2018)

Norris started his career in [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md), a backyard federation based in the Toru≈Ñ area. His first match took place in June 2016, where he was one of the contenders in [Tournament of Dreams](@/e/dfw/2016-06-11-dfw-tournament-of-dreams-1.md), losing in the quarter finals to [Charlie](@/w/madman-charlie.md). He was portrayed as a babyface persona, and from his debut he appeared at the majority of DFW shows. The highlight of his career in DFW came at [Charity Gauntlet](@/e/dfw/2018-03-08-dfw-charity-gauntlet-match.md) in March 2018, where he defeated [Direk](@/w/direk.md), [Chris Hunter](@/w/chris-hunter.md), Hekate and Steven Seagal in a Gauntlet Match for the vacated [DFW Championship](@/c/dfw-championship.md). As the champion he managed to score yet another successful defence against [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) at [Crosswords City 2](@/e/dfw/2018-06-09-dfw-crosswords-city-2.md) - the final show ever produced by Dream Factory Wrestling. 

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2018-2021)

After DFW's closure, Norris started his training in [Polska Akademia Wrestlingu](@/o/paw.md) - a dojo school connected to [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md). He made his debut at [Project 6: Death & Glory](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md) in a Rookie Battle Royal alongside another wrestlers, such as [Aron Wake](@/w/aron-wake.md), [Nathan Cross](@/w/gabriel-queen.md), [Krueger](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Ring Rat](@/w/sedzia-seweryn.md). Later on he returned as a villainous manager and Tag Team partner of Nathan Cross, forming a short alliance between them for the duration of the [Project Basement](@/e/mzw/2021-03-18-mzw-project-basement-1.md) programme. After the COVID-19 pandemic ended, Isnorr made yet another, final appearance in MZW at [Project 8: Golden Road FINALS](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md) where he took part in a Triple Threat Match against Deti Black and Krueger. 

During his MZW tenure, Isnorr along with numerous other wrestlers started an insider group called ["The Greens"](@/a/the-greens.md), which later on would become influential across all of the Polish wrestling scene. 

### PpW Ewenement (2021-present)
