Links typeset in _italics_ are aliases used by a character besides their current name or gimmick.

Each name is followed by a list of organizations they appeared for.

Names that are not links represent talent that don't have a dedicated page yet. In that case, after each organization name, numbered links lead to events which feature that character. However, if a character has too many matches, only the organizations will be shown.

A flag appearing next to the name signifies that person's nationality. A missing flag usually means the person is Polish.
