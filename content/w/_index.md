Links typeset in _italics_ are aliases used by a character besides their current name or gimmick. \
Names that are not links represent talent that don't have a dedicated page yet. They are followed by organization names which the character appeared for. After each organization name, numbered links lead to events which feature that character. However, if a character has too many matches, only the org links will be shown.

A flag appearing next to the name signifies that person's nationality.
