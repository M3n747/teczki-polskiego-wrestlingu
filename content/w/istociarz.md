## Professional wrestling career
### Attempts to become a wrestler

Young Istociarz was a backyard wrestler, active in his small project, [NQW](@/o/nqw.md) as LJ Blade. Per his own account, he took part in [Don Roid](@/w/don-roid.md)'s original training camp, but painful training regimen and overall disorganization discouraged him from further trainings under Roid. After that, Istociarz limited his activity in wrestling to being a fan.


### Internet personality: Istota Wrestlingu (2023-)

In 2023, him along with his wife Martyna (also known as Istociara or Istotna Martynka) started a YouTube channel known as Istota Wrestlingu. A channel was initially slightly niche, commenting on recent wrestling shows in Poland. They prided themselves on attending every single Polish event and quickly got acquainted with most of their viewers personally. The channel also started inviting various wrestlers for long, in-depth interviews.
They gradually moved from pre-recorded podcast toward live transmissions, adding the video and creating their signature looks - cat-like lucha masks. The idea of masks, as per official explanation is to shift the focus away from the hosts toward the content itself.
After moving toward the live formula, the style also changed. Istociarz (then also known as Antek) gradually became more animated, coining the catchphrases such as _PASJA!_(_PASSION!_, exclaimed in specific way), _fuuuuuun_ and _Wake up! (to reality)_.

### PpW commentary (2025-)

After Martyna became an [Ewenement Dojo](@/o/ewenement-dojo.md) trainee, the relationship between Istota Wrestlingu and [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) has gradually grown. The channel featured PpW angles (notably - [Gustav Gryffin ](@/w/gustav-gryffin.md) laying out [Goblin](@/w/goblin.md) in a build up to their match), more PpW wrestlers (both live and in exclusive interviews). [Arkadiusz Paw≈Çowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) called the channel biased and "PpW's propaganda machine", rejecting the interview invitation (alternatively with claiming he never heard of the channel and never got the invitation).
On January 24th 2025, in an exclusive piece, MyWrestling confirmed that Istociarz would be added to PpW commentary team. Joining [Joker](@/w/joker.md) and replacing Szymon "Modzel" Modzelewski, he debuted at [Gruba Przesada](content/e/ppw/2025-01-25-ppw-gruba-przesada.md) and appeared on every show since.
