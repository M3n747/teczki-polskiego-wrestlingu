## Professional wrestling career

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2021-2023)

Chris X made his debut working for [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) at [Project 8](@/e/mzw/2021-08-14-mzw-project-8-golden-road-finals.md) - the first show after the COVID-19 pandemic.
He was one of the entrants in a Rookie Battle Royal, which was won by Michael Payne.
He made his Singles Match debut against Rubix at MZW's next show, [Game On](@/e/mzw/2023-03-11-mzw-game-on.md), which was held one and a half years later.
His last appearance for MZW took place at [Żadnych Granic](@/e/mzw/2023-09-23-mzw_ppw-zadnych-granic.md), where he faced [Biesiad Strong](@/w/biesiad.md) in a losing effort.

### PpW Ewenement (2023-2024)

Chris X's first appearance for [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) happened at [Turbo OG](@/e/ppw/2023-12-08-ppw-turbo-og.md) in December 2023. He intervened in a match between [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md) and Biesiad Strong, allowing Isnorr to secure a victory. Later on he took on [Johnny Blade](@/w/johnny-blade.md) in a Christmas Massacre Ultraviolent Match, in which he was defeated by the PpW original.
His grudge against Biesiad and Johnny led to a Tornado Tag Team Match at [Miasto Bezprawia](@/e/ppw/2024-02-10-ppw-miasto-bezprawia.md), where Chris teamed up with Isnorr. After they were defeated, Chris turned on Isnorr by striking him with a chair.

This angle however didn't led to any match, since soon after that Chris X retird from active wrestling, due to health problems following an injury. He did remain connected to the business, however, working as security at MZW and [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) shows.
