## Professional wrestling career

### 2016-2021 Maniac Zone Wrestling

  Boro started his wrestling career by training at MZW-operated Polska Akademia Wrestlingu in Głuchołazy in 2016. He made his debut the next year at [MZW Freak Show](@/e/mzw/2017-12-02-mzw-freak-show.md) where he participated in a tag team match and a battle royal. He debuted under his slighty modified real-life name "Bartosz Borowsky". He then changed his ringname and gimmick to "Lady Killer" - a cocky heel womanizer persona. He performed as Lady Killer for the most part of his stint in MZW, mostly during "Project" era when he appeared on most of the shows. He also become one of the founding members of ["The Greens"](@/a/the-greens.md)
During COVID pandemic Boro did not appeared on MZW Basement shows and quietly left the federation in early-to-mid 2021.

### 2021-2024 Prime Time Wrestling

#### Debut and PAKA formation

Boro joined new federation owned by [Arkadiusz Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md) called [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) fairly early in its development. During training and preparation he was paired with [Taras](@/w/taras.md) and [Disco Pablo](@/w/disco-pablo.md) as Trio called PAKA. They were portrayed as laid back polish babyfaces who know each other since childhood. Boro kept tiny part of "Lady Killer" gimmick in his new persona by being a group ladies' man, but due to family-friendly attitude in PTW his gimmick was much more toned down.
For first couple of shows PAKA focused on establishing themselves as babyfaces and Pawłowski's favourites against heels such as [Sinister](@/w/sinister.md), [Dziedzic](@/w/dziedzic.md) and [Remo](@/w/remo.md)

#### Injury and feud with Pure Gold

Later on Boro was scheduled to fight agains [John Bad Bones Klinger](@/w/bad-bones.md), who was feuding with Pawłowski by taking out his allies such as PAKA along the way. During that match Boro suffered knee injury which was his weak point back in the MZW days of his career. For couple of next shows Boro was sidelined as manager of his PAKA teammates, while they stared a feud with Pure Gold - the team of [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md) and [Vic Golden](@/w/vic-golden.md), which would later evolve into Tag Team Tournament for [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md). 
Boro made his recovery around [PTW Underground #12](@/e/ptw/2023-02-26-ptw-underground-12.md) where he faced Syriusz Dziedzic. He made it just in time to help PAKA in feud with Pure Gold and newly-founded Legia Łysych - [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md) and [Marco Hammers](@/w/marco-hammers.md) with [Karyna](@/w/karyna.md). 
At [PTW #4: The Mystery](@/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery.md) Boro lost to Olgierd, but in the main event of the show he made a save to help his tag team partners win PTW Tag Team Championship in a tables match agains Pure Gold.

#### PTW Tag Team Champion, second injury and departure

Despite the fact that Boro did not win [PTW Tag Team Championship](@/c/ptw-tag-team-championship.md) and neither defended it in a match he was considered as champion due to "Freebird Rule". Later on he continued to feud with Legia Łysych and Gabriel Queen, as Vic Golden suffered an injury around that time. 
At [PTW Underground #17](@/e/ptw/2023-09-03-ptw-underground-17.md) he faced [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) who at that time was feuding with Pawłowski. During that match Boro suffered keyfabe injury to the knee caused by Longman and he was oficially sent on rehabilitation in France for undisclosed time. 
Boro has not officialy left the federation until [PTW Exits](@/a/ptw-exits.md) in June 2024, when he posted his "Last Dance Story" where he clearly supported leaving wrestlers such as his teammates from PAKA and members of his "Green Gang".
