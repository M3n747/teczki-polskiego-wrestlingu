## Professional wrestling career in Poland

### Prime Time Wrestling (2025-)

At [PTW: Nietykalni](@/e/ptw/2025-07-19-ptw-nietykalni.md) it was first announced that Moné was coming to PTW the following week. Initially met with disbelief, this was quickly confirmed by both parties and [PTW: All About the Moné](content/e/ptw/2025-07-27-ptw-all-about-the-mone.md) was announced.

In her PTW debut, Moné was set to challenge [Diana Strong](@/w/diana-strong.md) for the inaugural Bestya Women's Championship. At the same show, it was announced that [PTW Women's Championship](content/c/ptw-womens-championship.md) tournament is off the books and the title was added as to the stakes of Moné vs Strong. Moné won in a competitive main event to capture both championships.
