## Professional wrestling career

### Kombat Pro Wrestling (2019-2020)

Daniel Boza debuted in [Kombat Pro Wrestling](@/o/kpw.md) in August 2019 at their show [Godzina Zero 2019](@/e/kpw/2019-08-17-kpw-godzina-zero-2019.md). He was one of the contenders in Magnificent Seven Elimination Ladder Match, but he failed to score a win in his debut fight. His gimmick was based on his previous MMA background and he played babyface-leaning persona. At [Arena 15](@/e/kpw/2019-11-16-kpw-arena-15-swieza-krew.md) he was set to face [Moloch](@/w/moloch.md), but due to his injury he instead faced [Chemik](@/w/chemik.md), scoring a win in his first Singles Match in career. He made yet another - and final - apperance for KPW at [Arena 16](@/e/kpw/2020-02-01-kpw-arena-16-polowanie.md). In the build-up to the match a series of horror-themed vignettes were published. In a payoff of these vignettes it was announced, that Boza will face [Lesak](@/w/eryk-lesak.md). He managed to win his match.

After Arena 16 a pandemic lockdown happened. During that time Boza seemingly left KPW.

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2024)

After his departure form KPW Boza joined [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md), which was owned by ex-KPW announcer [Pan Pawłowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md). He made his debut as a heel called Michał "Mutant" Świątkowski in a Battle Royal Match at [PTW #1: REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md). The match was won by [Nano Lopez](@/w/nano-lopez.md). 

After REVOLUCJA Mutant seemingly suffered an undisclosed injury and disappeared from PTW for nearly 3 years before making his return in February 2024 at [PTW #5: Gold Rush](@/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush.md) where he took part in Gold Rush Rumble Match for [PTW Championship](@/c/ptw-championship.md). He managed to eliminate [Max Speed](@/w/max-speed.md) before being eliminated by [Wiktor Longman](@/w/wiktor-longman.md) shortly after. He later revealed that he suffered another shoulder injury during his return. 

This marked his last apperance in PTW, as he publicly [announced his departure](@/a/ptw-exits.md) from federation in June 2024. From this time he was often active in social media, possibly teasing his apperance in either KPW or [PpW](@/o/ppw.md), but it did not happened.
