## Professional wrestling career

### Prime Time Wrestling (2021-2022)

Nick Aldis made his debut on Polish soil at the first ever show produced by [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md): [PTW #1: REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md). During the build-up to the show he was promoted as one of the biggest stars of the roster, along with ex-WWE superstars Chris Masters and Axel Tischer. In the main event of REVOLUCJA he faced ex-[KPW](@/o/kpw.md) wrestler [Gracjan Korpo](@/w/gracjan-korpo.md). The match was met with mixed reviews from public, especially due to numerous botches and significant difference in wrestling proficiency between Aldis and Korpo. At the end of the show Chris Masters intervened, and in the mix-up Aldis struck Korpo with his briefcase. It got noticed by [Referee Matek](@/w/sedzia-matek.md), who disqualified Aldis. After the match Nick got involved in physical alteraction with Masters, which started their build-up for a fight at the next PTW show. The match took place at [PTW #2: BlackOut](@/e/ptw/2022-02-19-ptw-2-blackout.md), and resulted in Aldis defeating Chris Masters.

BlackOut marked the last apperance of Nick Aldis in Prime Time Wrestling. When it was announced that he will join World Wrestling Entertaiment PTW officialy congratulated him on their social media platforms.
