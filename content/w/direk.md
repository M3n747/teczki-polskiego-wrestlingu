## Professional wrestling career

### Dream Factory Wrestling (2016-2018)

Direk made his wrestling debut working for Toruń-area based promotion [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md) in August 2016 at their show [Tournament of Dreams II](@/e/dfw/2016-08-20-dfw-tournament-of-dreams-2.md), where he faced [Ravage](@/w/rafael-kid.md). From the start he became popular among the fans thanks to his exciting in-ring style and babyface persona. After his debut he quickly got into a rivalry against reigning [DFW Champion](@/c/dfw-championship.md) [Chris Hunter](@/w/chris-hunter.md). The duo faced each other three times, but Direk was unable to secure a victory over a champion in a Singles Match, losing his Championship Matches at [Step Two](@/e/dfw/2016-10-10-dfw-step-two.md), winning a Tag Team match at [Lesson of Respect](@/e/dfw/2016-10-29-dfw-lesson-of-respect.md) and again losing Last Man Standing Match at [Last Chance](@/e/dfw/2016-11-10-dfw-last-chance.md). 

After wasting his Last Chance on DFW Championship he tried to win #1 Contender Spot again in a match against [Charlie](@/w/madman-charlie.md), but again he was unsucessful. After a three win streak in non-championship matches, including a victory over Charlie in a No Holds Barred Match, he gained another opportunity on DFW Championship against his very first rival - Ravage. Falls Count Anywhere Street Fight at [Anniversary](@/e/dfw/2017-09-30-dfw-anniversary.md) ended in another Direk's defeat, however, due to Ravage vacating his championship after his transfer to [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) allowed Direk to again compete for it in a Gauntlet Match at [Charity Event](W/e/dfw/2018-03-08-dfw-charity-gauntlet-match.md), but he was again unable to win, as it was won by [Norris](@/w/isnorr.md).

Direk amde his last appearance for DFW at their last ever show [Crosswords City 2](@/e/dfw/2018-06-09-dfw-crosswords-city-2.md) in June 2018, where he has defeated [Pain Killer](@/w/pain-killer.md).

### PpW Ewenement (2017; 2019-2022)

Before oficially making his debut, Direk made guest appearance during famous [raid on PpW facility][szkoda] at [Winogronowa 17](@/v/winogronowa-17.md), where he and Charlie jumped [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) and [Cade Bruce](@/w/mister-z.md), who were mourning the loss of their ring. This angle didn't lead to any further storylines.

After DFW folded Direk started appearing in [PpW Ewenement](@/o/ppw.md) in part-time role. He won his debut match against Rob Scaffold at [Kiedyś Będzie Lepiej](@/e/ppw/2019-07-13-ppw-kiedys-bedzie-lepiej.md). After the pandemic break he returned at [PpW's Supershow in Poznań](@/e/ppw/2021-07-30-ppw-poznan-supershow.md). At [Inside Job](@/e/ppw/2021-09-11-ppw-inside-job.md) he lost a rematch against Scaffold. Direk made his last appearance for PpW at [Mistrz Jest Tylko Jeden](@/e/ppw/2022-03-12-ppw-mistrz-jest-tylko-jeden.md) where he teamed up with [Royal Striker](@/w/royal-striker.md) against his old DFW collegue [Isnorr](@/w/isnorr.md). Direk's protigee quickly got defeated by Isnorr, but when it come to a impromptu Two Out Of Three Falls Match Direk emerged victorious from this bout. After that show Direk seemingly retired from professional wrestling.
