Praga Centrum is a storage facility repurposed into a event hall.
The venue itself is operated as a partnership between _Luzztra_ and _Smolna_, the latter known as one of the top techno clubs in Warsaw, with techno & rave parties being the most common events taking place in this venue.
The venue distinguishes itself by owning a decent-sized open backyard area with a mini beach section, as well as a mezzanine level, which allows spectators to watch performances from a higher vantage point.
The capacity is approximately 600-700 standing spectators.

## Location

Praga Centrum is located in the Praga Północ district of Warsaw at Szwedzka 2/4 street.
It is located within walking distance of the "Dworzec Wileński" train station, and very close to the "Szwedzka" metro station.
Despite its localization on the right bank of the Vistula river, mass transit availability is fairly decent, allowing people to get there from the city center in less than 25 minutes.
