Waldorffa 25, located in Warsaw's district of Bemowo, is the name and address of a former military storage building repurposed as an event space. It became [PpW](@/o/ppw.md)'s primary venue for 2022 and 2023. This new place could comfortably fit many more spectators than the comparatively tiny [2 Ko≈Ça club](@/v/2kola.md). However, it's in a somewhat remote and undeveloped area of the city.

Besides wrestling, the venue hosts concerts, private parties, corporate and sports events, weddings, and was used a photo and video shooting location. The building itself is fairly nondescript - with brick walls, gently sloping roof, brick columns, and some widely spaced metal support beams.

Trivia: the [Botchamania segment](@/o/ppw.md#botchamania) when Biesiad Strong climbs onto some support beams, happened in this venue.
