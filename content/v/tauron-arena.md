Tauron Arena is a multipurpose arena located in Kraków, used for sporting events, concerts, religious rallies etc. The arena has the maximum capacity of 22&nbsp;000 people, making it the largest such venue in Poland.
The arena also includes an adjacent, smaller hall (dubbed "Small Hall"), which can be used for sports as well as for conferences and expositions.
Since 2022, [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md) have been holding annual shows at Ryucon, a manga and anime-themed convention taking place at the venue. First Ryucon show took place in a Small Hall, while 2023 and 2024 took place in the main venue.
In 2025, however, [Legacy of Wrestling](@/o/low.md) was booked to hold their [third show](@/e/low/2025-07-11-low-3.md) at Ryucon instead.
