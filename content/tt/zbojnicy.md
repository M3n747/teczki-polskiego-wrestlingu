Zbójnicy (_The Highwaymen_) were a tag team active in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) between 2015 and 2017, and the organization's first [Tag Team Champions](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md). The team consisted of [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) and [Stanisław Van Dobroniak](@/w/stanislaw-van-dobroniak.md).

The team's name refers to [Carpathian highwaymen][wiki-zbojnicy], robber bands who roamed the mountains of present-day Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. In folklore they not only robbed the rich but also gave to the poor, and in real life they were often oppressed peasants clawing back wealth from their feudal lords. Later in the 19th century they were also key symbols of resistance and independence. Such is their image in Poland as well - not as robbers, but freedom fighters, and they're perceived as heroes.

## History

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2015-2017)

Zbójnicy debuted at [Champions War](@/e/mzw/2015-05-31-mzw-champions-war.md) in 2015 where they challenged Projekt Gold (Nickolas von Rijk and [Robert Kaiser](@/w/robert-kaiser.md)) for Belgium Pro Wrestling Federation Championship. In May 2016 at [Beatdown](@/e/mzw/2016-05-14-mzw-beatdown.md) they became the inaugural [MZW Tag Team Champions](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md) after defeating [Kripto](@/w/kripto.md) and [Red Thunder](@/w/red-thunder.md). Their championship reign - and team activity - ended at [Charity Show in January 2017](content/e/mzw/2017-01-15-mzw-charity-show-2017.md) where they were defeated by [Storm Riders](@/w/storm-riders.md). 

In 2019 Stanisław was attacked by returing - now as a villain - Jędruś, which led to their Hardcore Match at [Project 5](@/e/mzw/2019-06-01-mzw-project-5-hero.md). It resulted in a Double KO and seemingly ended this short-lived feud.
