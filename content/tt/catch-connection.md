Catch Connection were a tag team formed by German wrestlers [Alexander Reich](@/w/alex-ace.md) and [Ronny Kessler](@/w/ronny-kessler.md), active between 2014 and 2018, mostly in Dresden-based Next Step Wrestling. 

## History

### Maniac Zone Wrestling (2014-2018)

In Poland, Catch Connection competed for [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) between 2015 and 2018, managing to win the [MZW Tag Team Championship](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md) after they defeated [Storm Riders](@/tt/storm-riders.md) at [Champions War III](@/e/mzw/2017-06-03-mzw-champions-war-3.md). They held onto the Championship for over a year without making a single defence - most likely due to lack of tag teams in MZW - until they were finally dethroned by [Wataha](@/tt/wataha.md). Later, both members returned in singles action.
