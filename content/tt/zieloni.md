"Zieloni" (_The Greens_) is the name of a group of Polish wrestlers who were originally connected to [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md) or started their career there. The name comes from the organization's primary brand color, and is sometimes cryptically abbreviated as _ZLN GNG_.

## History

#### Formation in Maniac Zone Wrestling

The group later named "Zieloni" formed itself from wrestlers and rookies who attended the 2018 edition of Summer Camp hosted by [Polska Akademia Wrestlingu](@/o/paw.md), a dojo operated by [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md). A few of the Zieloni knew each other either from training in MZW, backyard federations such as [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md), or from online activity, but the class of 2018 PAW Summer Camp was the one where most of them officially got together. From this point on they formed a strongly-bonded social group. The group was heavly influenced by the teachings of [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md), who brought a lot of experience from his stint on the UK wrestling scene, as well as his approach to wrestling. This philosophy pushed many of the Greens to quickly attempt wrestling abroad instead of only getting bookings in MZW, and to develop themselves as a performers, which proved beneficial to many of the Greens, such as [Jacob Crane](@/w/jacob-crane.md), [Axel Fox](@/w/axel-fox.md) and [Gabriel Queen](@/w/gabriel-queen.md), in their future. 

After [Project 6](@/e/mzw/2019-08-24-mzw-project-6-death-and-glory.md) both [Asmund](@/w/asmund.md) and Justin left the MZW creative team and PAW coaching staff, with Justin eventually leaving MZW altogether following MZW's [next show](@/e/mzw/2020-01-18-mzw-project-7-golden-road.md). 

#### Green Revolution and leaving MZW

During the COVID-19 pandemic break the Greens remained stronyl bonded, but due to the halt which was imposed on organising wrestling shows and trainings, in Poland as well as Europe, their morale went down. In the early-to-mid 2021 [Boro](@/w/boro.md) and Axel Fox left MZW. They were soon followed by Jacob Crane and Gabriel Queen. It was later revealed that they joined the newly-created federation owned by [Arkadiusz Paw≈Çowski](@/w/pan-pawlowski.md), [Prime Time Wrestling](@/o/ptw.md). During that time, the overall dissatisfaction among the remaining Greens, caused by the lack of development in MZW, caused many of the workers to go rouge and perform in [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) at [Ledwo Legalne](@/e/ppw/2021-06-12-ppw-ledwo-legalne.md) and [Pozna≈Ñ Supershow](@/e/ppw/2021-07-30-ppw-poznan-supershow.md) against MZW owner [Shadow's](@/w/shadow.md) will. Non-PTW Greens also attended [REVOLUCJA](@/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja.md) to support their friends who were working at that show.

27th of October 2021 was the final straw for the disagreement between Zieloni and the MZW management. What became known as "Zielona Rewolucja" (_The Green Revolution_) was a day-long quarell between the MZW management and the Greens led by [Olgierd](@/w/olgierd.md). The argument was caused by MZW's ban on training women, which was an excuse to lash out on MZW for many other problems, such as lack of any stable direction of MZW's development, irregular training schedule and the disapproval of MZW's Greens appearing at other federation's shows - even as spectactors, let alone as performers. Eventually, both sides were unable to reach an agreement, which led the remaining Greens to leave MZW the same day. 



However, not all MZW wrestlers are Greens. The group was started by wrestlers who joined in 2017/2018, and created a strongly bonded social group, connected by their wrestling endeavors. Thus, wrestlers like [Rafi](@/w/rafi.md) or [Sambor](@/w/sambor.md) who also started their training in MZW, or [Shadow](@/w/shadow.md) who created the organization, are not considered to be Greens.

## Influence

The Greens, aside from being a group of friends, were also one of the factions in [Prime Time Wrestling's](@/o/ptw.md) locker room.
The other factions were "The Originals" (who started in PTW) and "The Blues" (ex-[KPW](@/o/kpw.md)).
Sometimes, internal tensions in the organization were caused by disagreement between these groups, and the management.
This was mainly caused by differences in their approach to quality and wrestling philosophy, such as Justin Joy's harsh training regime, putting international bookings and personal development over his commitments to PTW, as well as critique of Paw≈Çowski's and the Originals' approach to the concept of "Polish Wrestling Without Boundaries", which prevented talent from competing in other Polish federations.

The group can be compared to the famous Kliq, active in WWE in the mid-1990s. The Greens were most active and influential in PTW since 2021 until mid-2024, when all of the remaining members left the organization.
Later they were also active in [PpW](@/o/ppw.md) since 2023.

## Trivia

* The Greens are also known as Zielone Ma≈Çpy (_Green Monkeys_) and their official mascot, used in their "shoot" promos and Instagram notes, is an orangutan "ü¶ß".
* The group has their own insider championship, called "ZLN GNG Championship", shown mostly on their social media during the group's meetings. It was created by modifying the [DFW championship](@/c/dfw-championship.md) belt, replacing its mainplate with a green one. The sideplates show wrestler Dave Batista.
