Wataha (_The Wolfpack_) were a short-lived tag team of [Apollo Anderson](@/w/apollo-anderson.md) and [Justin Joy](@/w/justin-joy.md), active during the "Project Era" (2018-2019) in [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md). They were the final [MZW Tag Team Champions](@/c/mzw-tag-team-championship.md), and never defended the title due to tensions between the two members.

After Apollo turned heel on Justin at [Project 4](@/e/mzw/2019-03-23-mzw-project-4-open-your-eyes.md) the team broke up, and GM [Jędruś Bułecka](@/w/jedrus-bulecka.md) stripped Apollo of his championship belt, retiring the title.
